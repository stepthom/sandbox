I compared this to some Belgian dark chocolate bars I had in the house and they contained no cholesterol at all.

If you are out hiking or somewhere else where water is available from a water fountain or stream (filter anything from a stream before drinking it) where you can get water along the way and add some flavor and vitamins with this product.  It will be lighter and easier than carrying bottles of some sort of sports drink with you.It tastes like Kool-Aid.  It's not delicious, not horrible, just sort of OK. There are, of course, a lot of other powdered and concentrated liquid mixes (similar to this one) that would serve the same purpose.  Nothing about this Vitamin Squeeze makes it stand out from anything else.  It has no calories which probably means it has chemicals instead of sugar.It is not something I'd be likely to purchase but if you need something more than water when you would otherwise have to either carry a lot of water weight or spend a couple bucks for each 16oz sports drink while out on the road this product may be more convenient and/or save you money.",3,Kool-Aid With Vitamins,1333756800

These things are sweet but not too sweet to face first thing in the morning, and they are awesome for dunking. You have to be careful though, they have a brittle texture that breaks easily, so if a piece falls into your cup it will dissolve before you can fish it out again.

It never did make a satisfactory flavored water, and even when I tried to use it to sweeten my hot tea, I was not pleased with the result.

Tastes really good.  The seasoning adds something that you wouldn't get just by adding hambuger to mac&cheese.;  And this is really good mac&cheese; as well.  Delivers a satisfying feeling of satiation without eating a large portion.  Real comfort food.Preperation is a snap.  After simmering 13 minutes it looked like there was too much water left over but by the time the food was served it had congealed enough not to be runny.If I were to try this again I'd use ground turkey instead of beef and less of it.  Maybe 12 oz instead of 16 and add a bit more mac to make up for it.  But if you want a satisfying, beefy meal you can't go wrong these Cheeseburger Skillets.Box says fat is 9g a serving, 3g of it saturated.  That would vary depending on what type of meat you added.  Sodium is 850g.  Highish but not unusual for this tupe of prepared meal.

I make a pitcher of tea or lemonade, but rarely both at once, it's just too hot. This Lipton instant Half & Half is pretty good. It's got that tart lemonade bite at the back of every sip, but leads with the soft, sweetness of good iced tea. It is a bit sweet if you follow the measurements on the can - at least for my tastes. But the beauty of a powder mix is you can adjust up or down until you find the perfect balance. The crystals dissolve very quickly when you stir it in and the flavor is good.

But I went ahead and gave it a shot because I'm trying to find a way to cut back on the amount of sugar I use in my beverages like coffee and tea. The first time I used the syrup I used a teaspoon in my cup of morning coffee in place of the usual sugar or flavored creamer I typically use.

Not a bad thing necessarily but just so you know.I got a seemingly giant, rectangular, pretty red tin with two trays filled with a lot of cookies (each tray has the same assortment).  There are two types of cookies that are predominantly white chocolate, with a third which is half-white and half-regular.  Then the rest are either dark or milk chocolate.  The cookies are what I would say is normal sized (i.e., for most people that would be two to four bites per cookie).  Inside the tin's lid is a chart describing each type and pointing out which ones have nuts, etc.These cookies seem to melt easily.  I took a chance on the end of the winter season in Florida, and they arrived sort of stuck together in their compartments, but generally I was able to break them apart.  Still I noticed that at room temperature they did get a little soft, such that they will easily leave chocolate on your fingers.  I just kept them in the refrigerator to get around that problem.I would say there are about 5-6 cookies of each type in its own compartment in the tray; so with two trays you are getting roughly a dozen of each type.  Some are much bigger than others, or thicker, so you get only 4 of that type.  But, it's a lot of cookies.I'm not really a tin collector, but I thought this really sturdy, pretty red tin was an added-value perk of this product.  It's a useful size for a lot of things and isn't covered with hokey illustrations like a lot of tins are.  Mine had a subtle textural patterning; unsure if they are all the same, as the photo on Amazon appears to show a tin that is shaped differently than the one I received.I would probably order these only occasionally, and during the cooler winter season, because they are so rich.  By the time we got to the end of the box, I experienced a sort of burn-out with them.",5,Good although in truth pretty repetitive in flavors,1398816000

The biggest problem with this variety pack is that it unashamedly promotes Krave above all the other cereals.Let me explain.I've already tried a regular box of Krave and found it way too sugary for my taste. Unfortunately this set includes 2 varieties of Krave, Milk Chocolate and Double Chocolate (as if the regular type wasn't enough to put me into a pre-diabetic coma). Out of a 24 gram pouch, for example, almost a third of it (9 grams) is made up of sugar. You read this right. A third.Not only is it overrepresented, but the pouches for Krave are BIGGER than any other pouches:Apple Jacks =.63 ozFruit Loops =.63 ozCorn Pops =.67 ozKRAVE double chocolate =.85 ozKRAVE milk chocolate=1 FULL oz.This is annoying. Kellogg is pushing this brand pretty hard and this variety pack is a promotional vehicle for it, hoping to entice consumers by bundling it up with much-loved favorites. I hate hard-sells. Instead of an extra set of Krave, Kellogg should have included its famous Corn Flakes, an obvious omission.On the positive side, these pouches are easier to store in the pantry though easier to crush than the buckets. The serving size is great for travel and for a kid's lunchbox.  However, for an adult's breakfast (and not as a snack), it is meager and one pouch is definitely not enough. I had to empty two pouches to equal my one adult serving. I've already gone through four pouches already, so you can bet these will not last long!Lastly, you are paying for convenience, not price, so it's not a great buy compared to buying a regular size box of Kellogg's cereal, measuring out one serving, and pouring it into a small ziploc bag. However, many parents don't have time to do this, so I guess this is the chief appeal of small packages like this.So overall, I would buy a Kellogg's variety pack again, but the bias toward Krave turned me off of this one.",4,"Variety Pack Promotes Krave, the Most Sugary Cereal of the Bunch",1385769600

They also have fractionated oil and a few other crappy things, but all in all this is at least relatively close to a healthy piece of food, by corporate standards at least. Of course anyone really serious about health will buy organic, but this is at least better than much of the pseudo-food coming out of the laboratories--sorry, ""kitchens""--of American mega-biz companies.I noticed the last time I gave a so-so rating to a food product that I wasn't offered any more for months on the Vine Program. I guess I was red-flagged for not drinking the kool-aid and for presenting an honest opinion. Nice to get another chance, and I will give Kraft props for presenting a semi-healthy health bar. But why not make it organic, folks? It's mostly grains and those are relatively cheap when organic, and SO much healthier than the Roundup-laden stuff that isn't organic.I'm loving that agribiz is scrambling to appear to care about America's health after feeding us carcinogens and maximum dumb-down swill for decades (look at our current situation...think the dumbing-down worked? Like a charm!). Well, they're starting to pull the HFCS from their crap, somewhat, so maybe our dollars really do speak. But in the meantime smart folks are buying organic and shopping for locally grown foods. How long before we stop agribiz from destroying all our topsoil with their toxic chemical-laden ""farming""? Better be soon, we're losing that soil mighty fast. Read up on it and learn some disturbing facts about what our idiot food choices have done to our soil and our family farmers--and are still doing. Every food dollar supports good local folks, if you spend it right.Only sustainable organic farming will turn our soil and our health around, so until then, all these ""health"" prodcuts with non-organic grains are just contributing to the destruction of our land and the few small farmers that agribiz hasn't yet crushed.

I add two teaspoons to iced tea, and if you don't smell it, I swear it tastes just like a lemon iced tea. Use it in coleslaw and salads; The possibilities are endless. Just don't use this vinegar when cooking food, because high heat kills all the beneficial enzymes swimming around in the vinegar that make it have such marvelous health benefits.And please don't complain about the taste. This is vinegar; you cannot get around that fact. If you can't stomach the taste, try using the smallest recommended amount (one teaspoon), dilute it in a large cup water or (natural) fruit juice, and just drink it.

They put about 85% FILLER in the bags (dextrose for one, which is sugar!). They do that so a cup of splenda will equal out to a cup of sugar, like BIG DEAL! I want to buy sucralose, not FILLER! Anyhow, I love powdered Drink mix, been using KOOL AID and Whylers UN-Sweetened where instead of adding sugar, I added Splenda. This 2.0 fl oz bottle came in from Amazon and I wanted to give it a try. It says on the bottle that 1 Teaspoon = 2 Cups of Sugar. I always make a Gallon of KoolAid, so that 2 cups equal is perfect! I made it as normal, put in the fridge, oh and I left one full glass of the Splenda version that was from the last pitcher I made. 3 Hours later I try the drink and it's not sweet at all. Very under sweetened. So I added 1 more teasoon to the gallon pitcher, tasted about the same as the splenda brand now. So it's really 2 Teasoons = 2 cups of sugar (or 1 teaspoon = 1 cup of sugar). It says this is = to a 10 LB Bag of sugar on the box the bottle comes in, so it's really half of that. Still, you get 11 cups worth of sugar from this bottle (going by the 5 LB Bag usage), it's still alot cheaper to buy this than the big bag of splenda, the price is about the same, give or take a few dollars for the spenda 9 oz bag, that you only get about 6 cups of sugar tops.I would deff buy this again and will when I run out. Just wish they made this into a larger bottle, I mean like a bottle of Ketchup size, sure it would cost $50, but I'd buy it. This won't last me a real long time and I have never seen this pure Sucralose in stores.I have also been using Stevia of lates, NOW Foods on Amazon sells a huge 1 LB jar of it for $45.

With these I had to restrain myself so I didn't eat too many of the prunes destined for the recipe.I did have a problem with spoilage in a similar product,Made In Nature Organic Apricots, Dried, Unsulfured, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6), which I detailed in that review. The spoilage was obvious by looking at the package (it puffed up like a balloon) and smelling...so I didn't eat anything nasty. To me, an occasional spoiled packet is a fine price to pay for an all-natural preservative-free product; others may disagree which is why I note it here.",5,Best prunes I've ever had in my life,1366243200

You can also bake and make other confections with it, but I recommend that, while you're learning to make the changeover, you use a mixture of agave and sugar until you know how your usual cooking methods will stand up to the change.

They are very attractive, so they also make nice gifts, stocking stuffers, easter basket stuffers, etc.  Even just handing one individually wrapped ball to someone will get a smile and a thanks.The downside is the very high fat content.

This is an even higher saturated fat content than the milk chocolate balls.  The ingredients are white chocolate, vanillin (artificial flavoring), vegetable oil (coconut, palm kernel), sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, milk, skim milk, soya lecithin and artificial flavors.Also, they melt easily, so you have to be careful about storage (the package recommends 60-68 degrees F).When I eat too many, I do notice an oily texture, perhaps due to the vegetable oil as the third ingredients.

When just one bottle arrived in the mail, all my plans went out the window and I simply opened the bottle and drank it.The water has a slightly bitter taste that is more noticeable if you drink several sips in a row and not so much when you take just one sip. I think it'd probably be less noticeable if you chilled the water first, but mine was warm from the mail carrier's vehicle.The bottle says this water contains ""about the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee"", which seems pretty vague to me. I roast my own coffee beans every week, rarely the same origin beans more than once, and they all contain different levels of caffeine and probably significantly more than this water. The small print on the bottom does let you know that there are 90mg of caffeine in the bottle. I had already had my coffee for the day when this arrived and I wondered if the extra 90mg of caffeine would make me jittery or something. I did feel a slight tightness in my chest for a short time after I drank it - kind of reminds me of why I don't take caffeine pills. There's just something about the caffeine in a quality cup of coffee or tea - chemically I guess they have the same components but somehow the extra somethings in coffee & tea seem to make the caffeine less harsh in the body. That's always been my experience, anyway. I don't do well with guarana, either.Speaking of the bottle, it's kind of a funny shape...maybe designed to take up more room on a shelf than 16.9 fl ounces normally would while still being stable in a car cup holder? It also has a solid silver print on the bottom that makes it difficult to see how much liquid is left in the bottle. Maybe not a big deal to some, but I have this THING about knowing exactly how much of something I'm eating or drinking is left.I can't really see myself buying a 12 pack of this from amazon - first of all I already have my daily cup of freshly roasted and ground coffee and the occasional cup of good quality tea, but secondly I'm just not that into the idea of bottled water - I think it's ridiculous to pay for something you get right from your faucet and to get it packaged in a hunk of plastic that will likely just end up in a landfill. Well, most of the time anyway. The time I can see purchasing this is when on a road trip, like driving through the hot, dusty San Joaquin Valley or down to Southern California or coming back from wine country, sleepy after a day of wine tasting and then a too-big dinner. It seems like a good alternative compared to a lot of other beverages you could buy in a convenience store.I'm giving this four stars based on the fact that I can think of a time when I would buy it and that my personal opinion of whether you SHOULD buy water in a bottle isn't necessarily related to the quality of this product as compared to other similar things you might buy.",4,a bottle of water...with caffeine,1340841600

Cooks beautifully in about 20 minutes without stirring or intervention of any kind if you use a double boiler.  Or better yet, load it into a programmable rice cooker the night before. The nutty, chewy texture is essential to the experience, and in that regard, the double boiler approach delivers a somewhat crunchier end result than my rice cooker, which creates a softer, more porridge-like oatmeal, due to the longer presoak and cooking time involved with the night-before approach.The cans keep quite a long time unopened---at least a year or two if the freshness dates are to be believed--- but I find the grains start to taste a littel stale or musty if you keep an open can more than a month or two.",5,"The way oatmeal was meant to be: sensual, not pasty",1172016000

32260,A3JCWGHCVC2ZNF,B00GLP9PY0,Sheri in Reho,"I love iced tea, so I was intrigued by the idea of a liquid that could instantly turn my water into iced tea. I tried the Strawberry Guava variety. I'm not sure I would enjoy it without ice but, with ice, it's fine. That said, it does not taste like flavored iced tea so much as a fruit drink. Generally, with fruit-flavored iced tea, you can still tell it's iced tea, but it has a fruit flavor added. This tastes more like fruit drink without any/much iced tea flavor.The taste is fruity, refreshing and may be too sweet for many folks--this comes from someone who likes her iced tea pretty sweet (using a combination of Equal and Sweet 'n Low). While the few reviews I've read have indicated that this product does NOT have an aftertaste, I would disagree. It absolutely does have an aftertaste to me, but it isn't the most offensive aftertaste I've ever had. I wouldn't want to drink this as my primary beverage, but as an occasional alternative to plain water, it is just fine.The nutrition facts on this product list 1g of Sugars and 1g of Sugar Alcohol. Honey is the first ingredient on the ingredients list, Glycerin is second and Sucralose (Splenda) is eighth. According to my research, Glycerin and Sucralose are both considered Sugar Alcohols. This product contains 0% fruit juice--the fruit flavor is coming from ""natural flavor.""The product comes in a small squeeze bottle that you could carry along to restaurants or to work. The package says it does not require refrigeration but should be used within a month of opening. It contains just under 2 1/2 ounces of liquid flavoring syrup and says it makes up to 24 servings. However, the serving size is a rather gray area. The directions say ""Add one squeeze for every 8 fl. oz. of water."" What you consider a squeeze may not be what I consider a squeeze, but I can say that one of MY squeezes results in a far too watery beverage for my taste. Two squeezes is tasty but a little overboard on the sweetness so, for me, somewhere between 1 1/2 and 2 squeezes does the trick. The product has 10 calories per squeeze.If you are one of the many people who don't like to drink water plain, this may be a great solution for you (as long as you don't have sensitivity to sucralose). HOWEVER, be mindful of the quantity you are drinking, as sugar alcohols can have some unpleasant side effects if consumed in larger doses.I'm a water drinker, but I've been in some restaurants where the water tasted horrible, so this would be a nice emergency standby product for those situations.3.25 stars",3,"Nice fruity taste and great convenience, but has an aftertaste.",1399161600

The pyramid shape of the tea bag allows those pieces more room to spread through the water so the infusion of flavor is stronger.The Blackberry Vanilla tea is a beautiful purple color which is actually from the hibiscus not the blackberry (although I'm sure the blackberry does contribute some of the color). Despite the name the hibiscus is also the dominate flavor which is true of most herbal infusions.

This coffee is much in that style.  Don't expect this to be sweet or creamy, those are the additives you'll need for a latte / cappuccino style coffee you'd find in a typical coffee house.  These, on the other hand, are black coffee with that hint of mint & mocha.  The flavor is great, but not overwhelming.  The addition of a creamer & sweetener can enhance that flavor, but it's up to you to choose what kinds or how much.  The coffee tasted very fresh & not overly bitter, it was a really mild yet smooth flavor.  Personally, I think mint mocha is usually a less common flavor that's only around during the Christmas holiday season, but I'd drink it more often if it was available.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","While nearly all my reviews on Amazon are of Books, Cds and DVDs, I do eat  (and love) peanut butter and so, after I saw this new &#8220;Natural&#8221; version of &#8220;SUPER CHUNK&#8221; on the supermarket shelf today and bought it, I thought I&#8217;d do some research at home and the Amazon listing came up. So I thought I should post a review here. Actually it&#8217;s more an information review, than a product review but I think you&#8217;ll find it informative.Looking at the side-by side jars of the Natural and the regular Skippy there are two differences: One is size. The Natural is an ounce smaller and contains 14 vs 15 &#8220;servinds&#8221;. (Both have 190 calories per serving) . The ingredients are the same in the same order except the regular has &#8220;Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils&#8221; which the Natural has &#8220;Palm Oil&#8221;.  So went  to Wikipedia and found this descriotion of the two oils:Hydrogenated peanut butter contains a small amount of hydrogenated vegetable oils, which are high in saturated fats, thought to be a cause of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke; these oils are added to prevent the peanut oil from separating from the ground peanuts. Peanuts and natural peanut butter, i.e., ground, dry roasted peanuts without added oils, do not contain hydrogenated oils or trans fats. A U.S. Agricultural Research Service (ARS) survey of commercial peanut butters in the U.S. showed that trans fats were undetectable, i.e., below the detection limit of 0.01% of the sample weight.Some commercial peanut butters advertised as &#34;natural&#34; are actually stabilized with palm oil, which provides the same benefit of emulsion.[15][16] But to call this &#34;natural&#34; is a stretch: as former Skippy plant manager Frank Delfino has observed, &#34;That may be natural someplace, but it's not natural in nature.&#34;[17] A 2006 study supported by the National Institutes of Health and the USDA Agricultural Research Service concluded that palm oil is not a safe substitute for hydrogenated oils, because palm oil is highly saturated, causing adverse changes in the blood concentrations of LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B just as trans fat does.[18][19] A 2011 analysis of 23 countries showed that for each kilogram of palm oil added to the diet annually, there was an increase in ischemic heart disease deaths. The increase was much smaller in high-income countries.[20]Based on this information &#8211; and knowing that there is more danger in the Palm Oil than the Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil &#8211; I returned the two other jars of the Natural version and exchanged for the regular (and actually &#8220;healthier&#8221;) version. As for taste, I didn&#8217;t notice any difference.I&#8217;m really disappointed in Skippy for this &#8220;game&#8221; they are playing, but I guess I&#8217;ll keep buying it; just the one that is &#8220;safer&#8221;I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",2,This NATURAL version is actually unhealthier than the &#8220;regular&#8221; one.

Over the last few years I've found that increasing my fiber intake is a great way of losing weight and maintaining it, so I try to get around 30g a day. Foods high in fiber fill you up more quickly and aid in digestion, The Daily Recommended Value of fiber for adults is 25g per day. Most people in America probably get much less than that, closer to 7-10g a day. At 9g of fiber per serving, just eating one of these bars a day will provide a lot of assistance in meeting the DRV.In addition to the fiber content, the bars really taste great. I've never been a fan of granola-type bars, and figured with a name like ""Fiber One"" these would taste like cardboard, but they are one of the best meal bars I've eaten. They are moist and have a good texture. All of the ingredients seem fresh.At 4g, these bars are very low in saturated fat (they contain poly and monounsaturated fats - the ""good fats).

I suggest a quick trip to the fridge if it's hot outside because the bar was too sticky to get out of the wrapper.  The stickiness and warmth didn't affect the flavor however.

Both.(OK, Review The Product, Not The Principle.)Living and being the cook in a home which has recently gone (or as best I can) gluten free (and not out of a truly clinical health concern) I can say that whatever the reason, I am glad for products such as these. Up until fairly recently, while it was not impossible to find gluten free products, it was nearly so to find ones that could be considered acceptable substitutes.And pasta was high on the list. Early varieties I chose were truly horrid, clearly designed for people who had no choice- shaped correctly, but odd of color; and chewy, with a texture and taste that could in no way be considered acceptable or in some cases even recognizable. And could overpower almost any sauce.I recently discovered a relatively major brand on the grocery store pasta shelf now had a GF spaghetti. I gave it a try and was optimistic. It was not completely the right color, but close, which I considered a good sign. I found the taste and texture to be not a whole lot worse than any other brand of normal boxed pasta that had been sitting on a shelf for years and then served undercooked.I was pleased to see that now Barilla had thrown their capellini into the ring, as it were- despite their personal views on family life in America, they are still considered one of the world&#8217;s major pasta manufacturers. I figured it could be no worse.I cooked a batch of the Barilla, the Ronzoni, and some stale non-GF Barilla I had sitting around. As I expected, they were more or less the same, which is a good thing, I guess. Unfortunately, it was a bit harder to cook the texture on the GF correctly, it seemed to go from a sort of &#8220;al dente&#8221; to &#8220;slime&#8221; a lot more quickly than the non. Seemed to be no matter how it was cooked, to be a little bit more chewy than non GF. Taste? Right out of the pot, it seemed just a bit- off somehow. Not bad, but since I was unable to get it to a familiar consistency, just- off. Next came a bit of olive oil, then later a simple white sauce, and ultimately a full-on Bolognese. And obviously, the deeper the sauce, I would have to say the substitution would unlikely be detected.Do not forget that for the purpose of this review I am pretending that &#8220;real&#8221; pasta does not exist, that you have never enjoyed had the delight of making your own fresh pasta and then using it  to prepare a favorite dish. It goes without saying that anyone who prefers this would not so much as consider using the boxed variety for anything short of a dire emergency, and even then, might just make other plans.The fact that a major manufacturer such as  Barilla has jumped on the gluten-free bandwagon is encouraging. The fact that in most cases, buying into this trend will set you back about 400% more $, is not.",4,"Product, not principle.",1393804800

Of course this can change over time. But at the time of writing this review, it had the best price.Cons:- There is still a mild bitter taste. This is easily mitigated with a pre-wash. If you are still bothered by this I recommend Roland instead. There is absolutely no bitter taste.Small tip on how long to prewash: keep washing until most of the bubbles are gone. The saponin is what gives it the bitter taste and the bubbles when you wash with water.I generally put water in the pot, slosh the quinoa in the pot with my hand, pour off most of the water and repeat until most of the bubbles go away.2 Quick Recipe ideas:1. Cook along with rice in a rice cooker to add a bit of crunch to rice.2.

Bagged teas are usually the lowest quality tea and are mainly a convenience. That's not to say that there aren't exceptions, but after drinking lose leaf green, oolong and black teas, I can really taste the difference now.Newer pyramid pouches have help to improve the quality of single serve teas, but what is in whatever style pouch is still of the utmost importance. In this case, I was impressed. Pu'erh often has an earthy flavor that some might find off-putting, but here I found it mild and to actually be a decent quality tea. The ginger flavored aspect of it is almost unnoticeable, but I do think it adds to the character of the cuppa. I think Numi is one of the better ""mass"" tea purveyors, and with their Ginger Pu'erh Tea Bags, they offer an enjoyable Pu for the masses. It has a somewhat generic flavor, but that isn't a bad thing here. That only mean it might appeal to a broader audience.In the past, those looking to enjoy a cup of Pu would need to buy a brick of it from China, chop off a chunk and shred it, and then seep it according to strict traditional methods. Here, you can get it in boxed, in a bag, and easily steeped in hot water. For me, the best method was to steep it in my large coffee mug with hot water from the company water cooler for about 2 minutes. I then saved the tea bag for another session, this one taking about 4 minutes. It begins to lose it's flavor on the third steeping though is still drinkable (6+ minutes), but by the fourth it is pretty much done.Numi's Ginger Pu'erh Tea Bags are worth trying if you are new to Pu and just want to give it a taste, or if you normally drink it, but want a convenient and portable package for on the road or at work. It can't compare to some of the really good old leaf Pu that you can buy in bulk online, but the price is right for what you get.~ Kort",4,Better Than Expected,1368230400

It is always good to find new varieties and this medium brew is delicious. Surprisingly full-bodied, and although not truly bold, it is close, so if lighter brews are preferred, this might be a little too strong. Of course, economically, additional water can be added to make a larger, weaker cup of coffee.  Out of the box, one of these T-Discs makes an eight ounce cup, and there are fourteen discs per package.Smooth flavor, no strong acidic notes, like the Gevalia that I dislike, and after cooling, I've noticed some brands have an odd aftertaste, but the President's Choice stays true whether hot or cool.

From the product name to its packaging to its touting of the many healthy ingredients used, it looks like it's some sort of wonder health food.

If you're looking for a sweet treat and you're debating between, say, this and a candy bar, I'd definitely urge you to go for this.  However, it's certainly worth noting that this product has a lot of added sugar so, for all its otherwise fairly healthy ingredients, you'd be better off eating some fruit or a slice of whole grain bread with whole fruit spread.However, as a treat, I think these little bites are nice.  I like the crunch and the contrasting textures of the oats and sesame seeds.  The serving size is generous--over 40 bites--but the pieces are small, so you may not be getting as much as you think you are.  Still, because these are so full of contrasting textures, I find that I only need a small amount to satisfy a serious chocolate craving.

5362,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B001EQ51NA,"Patricia ""A Reader""","MR. Z BEEF BRAND PREMIUM BEEF JERKY is the very first beef jerky Ihave ever eaten!  But I've always been curious about this hiking-and-reputed-army-favourite, however, and so I decided to try it.  Hopefullythis review will help others who have never tried beef jerky before..as well as those who have eaten it before.I notice other Amazon reviewers state that it is not as dried out asmost beef jerky is.  I guess it isn't...even I have had meat thatwas more dried out than this beef jerky...and the meat I had wasn'teven beef jerky!  I understand that beef jerky is DEHYDRATED meat,it is dehydrated for the same reason that other food is dehydrated --to make it last longer, (for hiking, etc.), without refrigeration.(The package proudly proclaims: ""NO REFRIGERATION REQUIRED"", near thebottom of the back of package -- but this is presumably for UNOPENEDpackages, ONLY -- because, further up on the back of the package,the instructions, 'AFTER OPENING, REFRIGERATE OR EAT WITHIN THREEDAYS"", are also given.  (Both instructions are on the LEFT side ofthe back of the packet).This semi-soft meat gives much flavour!  I've alwaysliked teriyaki favouring...but have usually found it far, far too salty.Here, the teriyaki is definitely present, and definitely salty...but notas salty as teriyaki sauce. This is probably because, also included inthe ingredienets is ""smoke flavouring""....which is somewhat teriyaki-like in itself, but which has little or no salt, depending on the flavour of the liquid smoke. (The flavour of the liquid smoke is not given here.)  But, I guess when the two are combined, there is less salt then therewould be with teriyaki flavour, only.As in all dehydrated and dried food, the beef jerky is somewhat on the stiff side when first taken out of the package.  Chewing it gives youmore excercise than chewing most other foods!  To this beginner at beefjerky, the energy required to chew it reminds me of chewing a slightly-stiff, new stick of chewing-gum!  Not that difficult, really, once youstart, (at least with MR. Z - brand beef jerky) -- but don't expectthe ease of eating pudding or quiche, fellow first-time beef-jerky eat-ers!  (Is this why they say, ""Real Men Don't Eat Quiche"", I wonder?)So, you get a bit of EXCERCISE along with nutrition here!  Meat alwaysgives nutrition -- and sure enough, 12 grams of protein are listed foreach one ounce serving.  There are 4 servings in each 4 ounce packet.Each serving has 80 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 4% of the RDA of iron.Unfortunately, each serving also has 540 mg of salt!  So, even thoughit's not quite as salty as teriyaki sauce, you defintely can taste thesalt -- and it is a product obviously to be eaten with care, (if eatenat all), by those on low-sodium diets!Also unfortunately -- the ingredients listed, along with beef, water, soy sauce, salt, smoke flavouring, maltodextrin, garlic powder. soybean oil, onion powder, and hydrolyzed (water-induced?) soy protien -- also include, (perhaps inevitably, due to the process involved in making all beef jerky) -- monosodium glutamate, silicon dioxide, glychol propylene, flavouring, (which can be anything, really), erythorbate,sodium nitrate, and caramel colour.  Well, at least sodium nitrAte is used, and not the rumoured-worse-for-the-body sodium nitrIte.)  Still,all these artificial ingredients do give me pause...  Luckily, they are all listed underneath the natural ingredients here, and, as ingredients are to be listed, by US law, in Decending order, that means there are more of the natural ingredients here than the artificial and chemical ones.  As I said, perhaps these artificial and chemical ingredients are necessary because of the dehydrating and curing processes....but still, this is far from organic beef!  It may be considered a necessity for some, when camping and hiking however...and I have devised a little trick, myself, whenever I eat products with too many artificial or chemical ingredients for my taste.  It may not do too much....but Ialways try to DRINK TEA directly after eating, (and if possible,also before eating, such foodstuffs.  This is all my own idea -- I've never heard of anyone else doing this, but it seems to me -- what withtea's reputed anti-oxident and other benefits -- that drinking teaafter eating foods with artificial ingredients at least help somewhatin helping to ameliorate their reputed harmful and deleterious effects. (That is, at least a little, tiny bit...and maybe, perhaps, a bit more...?)  But one still wishes that a more natural curing and dehydratingprocess could be found and/or used.Thoughtfully included in this package is a tiny packet of ""Oxy-Free 504""([...]  The words ""Oxygen Absorber"" are written on the packet as well, which describes the purpose of this ""DO NOT EAT"" enclosure -- which is to keep the meat fresh.  As well as the meat itself, this tiny golden packet can, I think, be refrigerated as well....to be used again when keeping other items fresh, if one wishes.  (But don't use it for too long...tiny air holes in the packet allow the freshener to work, butalso will stop it's usesfullness after a while).All in all, this is a very good product. It is very, very tasty!  And, as far as beef jerky goes, it is not tough at all!  It proudly proclaims, on the front of the packet, that it is made from grain-fed beef, (the best kind!).  Also, that it is 96% fat-free!  (Just looking at the meat pieces within tells you this is true...very, very little fat is visible -- and this is a great thing to see!)  Writing on this packet of beef jerky, (both front and back), proudly proclaims it to be a PRODUCT OF BRAZIL, and it is inspected and passed by the Brazillian Ministry of Agriculture, It has both the signature and seal of the ""Ministerio da Agricultura"" of Brazil printed on the back of package.  It is distributed by IFC, International Foods Company, 6323 NW 99th Avenue, 33138, ([...]) A contact phone number is also given on the packet.This product has a l-o-n-g shelf life.  I received it today, May 28, 2008, and the expiration date is January 23, 2009.  With the prices of meat going up every day, it might be a good idea to buy and keep at least some of this beef jerky in your kitchen, even if you don't go hiking orexploring, or aren't in the army!  And this really does seem to be PREMIUM beef jerky, as the product's name implies.  If you want beefjerky, I believe that MR. Z PREMIUM BEEF JERKY is the brand to buy, (and especially in the teriyaki flavour, for all us teriyaki-flavour lovers!)",4,"TASTY, __NUTRITIOUS, __GIVES__EXCERCISE, __BUT........",1211932800

Coconut is kinda sweet in itself, I have no idea why they load it with sugar.Anyway these flakes are so flavorful. There are a trillion ways you can use them. They are also so fresh.Some people have said in their reviews they are dry... well I suppose that is inevitable because they need to dry the coconut meat in order to preserve it. Also, obviously these will tend to be more dry than those shredded finely because finely shredded flakes will have more surface in contact with moisture from other foods (or your mouth if one eats them alone) and thus will absorb more moisture than large flakes. But it is very easy to shred them more finely with a food processor or similar tools.

However I believe it's the addition of Hibiscus Flowers and Rose Hips to the blend that changes the traditional orange flavors. Because it's such a lightly flavored tea, it's not one that can really be over brewed. It's a good tea for those who like them very mild, almost like flavored water.

A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid. For me, the sodium level is just about right but I happen to believe that most products are too salty and that high sodium levels may have as much to do with American's expanding waist lines as HFCS.

They are very easy to prepare and handle.  Because I am a single man who works two jobs, I don't have much time for cooking.  Therefore, I like recipes that are so simple that your pet monkey can be trained to prepare them.I've used many of the other Barilla PLUS noodles already [Barilla Penne Plus, 14.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)andBarilla Thin Spaghetti Plus, 14.5 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 20)].  The Barilla PLUS Rotini noodles tend to have more flavor and be thicker and coarser in texture than the regular Barilla Rotini [Barilla Rotini, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 16)].  With their additional protein and fiber, they should also be more nutritional.  The extra fiber is great for someone like me who suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).Here is the simple meal that I recently cooked for my girlfriend, Tammy.

One may vary them according to availability in your local grocery store.

Spray a 13"" X 9"" X 2"" baking pan with Pam (Pam Cooking Spray, Baking, 5 oz).  Fry turkey meat in a skillet, drain fat.  Boil noodles according to its package.  Add fried meat and boiled, drained noodles to a pot containing mushrooms, stewed tomatoes and pasta sauce.  Simmer in the pot until thoroughly warm.  Add ingredients of the pot to the baking pan.  Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella cheese and bake for 20 minutes.I also sliced up a couple of green zucchini and yellow squash and steamed them for ten minutes using my OXO Good Grips Silicone Steamer (OXO Good Grips Silicone Steamer, Green).This is a deliciously simple meal that anyone can prepare.

It comes in a sealed bag and when you open it, the aroma is tantalizing.  Too bad it is so short lived.  Unless you are going to drink 12 cups of coffee, or have a bigger family who will in one day, that is the last fresh cup you will get.  There is no bottom to this K-cup except what would be around a pod of coffee so the air destroys it quickly.  After I took out the few we would need for breakfast, I sealed the unused ""k-cups"" in a plastic bag, but for the next couple mornings when I got some out, the aroma had faded more and more.  I love the way the original K-cups stay fresh until you use them, and these are not like that.  I also didn't like how I couldn't put them in my carousel of other K-cups.  Kind of a pain to have them sealed in the cupboard until I wanted them.  Don't get me wrong, the coffee was excellent when we first opened the package, but the quality diminished quickly.  If you are one of those people who drinks the same kind of coffee every morning and have several people drinking it, this may work for you.

I'm in sales, so I'm all for marketing, but this seems a lil disingenuous.Second and more importantly, its all rather blah. They have four medium roasts that are meh at best, and they all tasting the same. Columbian is probably the best but weak. Brooklyn bridge and boardwalk blend are best brewed on your smallest setting and in big batches and Donut Shop (extra bold) is a whole lot of concentrated mediocrity.  Do we need four medium roasts, really? Lets make one delicious one!

Knowing how k-cups work and how you can control your size, who wouldn't want extra bold? Regardless they are all weak and lacking. And JUST MAKE ONE THATS THE BEST!! Express-o would be my fave, if only they make it extra bold. The rest were only ok. In my sample pack the fuhgeddaboutit was delsih. I ordered a box. Somehow it wasn't nearly as good.

Cinnamon Subway is relish too. Caramel is third with oh fudge and vanilla sky nipping at its heals. Hazelnut was sort of a miss for us.

I pondered how I would use the mix and decided that rolling cookies is too tedious.  I hate rolling and cutting cookies! I was going to shape them into a roll, refrigerate and then slice, as the package directs, but that isn't what I did either.

I added the mix and worked it and the butter with my hands until it was a crumbly consistency.  I beat a large egg into the mix, which gave me a rather sticky dough.  I patted this dough into a greased 8x8 inch pan (which was pretty easy) and baked it for 25 minutes.  I allowed the pan to cool, and meanwhile made the topping: 8 oz of cream cheese, softened; 1 can of sweetened, condensed milk (usually specified as Eagle Brand, but I used Wegmans), 1 teaspoon of vanilla; and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.  I beat this with a hand mixer and when the cookie crust in the pan was cool, I spread the topping on it and chilled it.  Some kind of fruit or pie filling to finish it off would be nice, but I didn't happen to have any.I had no trouble cutting the cookie crust and topping after it was completely cooled and in the fridge for a while.

Since I am wise enough to bypass the snack aisle at the supermarket, I only tasted it thanks to a free promotional package I received from Amazon to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. Deceptively advertised as having ""50% Less Fat"" than regular potato chips, it still comes in at a whopping 150 calories per serving, of which a significant 30% come from fat. What's far worse though is that the bag is 4.5 ounces, which translates in the minds of the General Mills nutritionists as four midget-sized servings per bag. That means it will take you about five minutes to wolf down 600 calories!Moderation is the key, but it is a great challenge here because the Turtle is a tantalizing mix of caramel popcorn (with the kernels shucked completely away), honey-roasted peanuts, Chex cereal in both caramel and chocolate flavors, mini-pretzel rings and little spherical milk-chocolate candies. There isn't an undesirable ingredient on the list, and General Mills has obviously perfected the sweet-and-savory taste, i.e., the chocolate does not overwhelm everything else, as I couldn't put it down once I tore open the seemingly small bag.

I eat sprouted wheat bread, but I'd never seen rprouted rice before running across Annie Chun's.One thing that I dislike about brown rice is the very chewy texture and apparently that problem is solved by sprouting. The texture is more like white rice and the flavor is fabulous. I ate it the first time with just a little salt and it was the first time I've truly enjoyed brown rice on its own. It's terrific as a light lunch with some soy sauce.It took one minute in my microwave and the serving size is quite generous. With the addition of some veggies or meat, it would make a substantial lunch for me. As a side dish, I think it would serve two well since I don't really believe in serving huge portions of starches, even healthy ones.What was even more impressive is that my 'meat and taters' hubby loved it, too.

It really tasted like it had been sitting under an engine exhaust somewhere,  SO AWFUL we dumped out every pot we brewed.  We normally drink Equal Exchange brand and I thought I would take my chances on this due to the reviews so I could have an evening coffee.  I still gave it two stars because I think any company that goes through the process of keeping their product organic, water processed and remotely fair trade deserves kudos.I think the main reason I didn't like it is because I normally like lighter roasts such as Columbian, and this is a dark roast.  The lighter the roast, the higher the caffeine content.  The darker, the lower the caffeine.  So both my husband and I have stayed with and have refined tastes for the lighter side of coffee when it comes to roasts.  I occassionally like dark roasts so I thought it might be a shoo-in.  Unfortunately, I got six bags of this with high hopes and since then I have been having to give it away to random people hoping they will like it.  Especially those I know that like darker roasts flavor.I am going to try either Equal Exchange's decaf or Jim's Organic ""Together"" decaf on vitacost next time.  So far, the only decaf I like is the Safeway brand 100% Columbian decaf but we have decided after much research on how coffee is processed that ORGANIC is the only way to go.

I can't speak for the other flavors (YET) but green apple's a winner, clearly due to the care the manufacturer has put into her product which includes simple ingredients of fine quality. And FWIW, it's both vegetarian and kosher. By all means, give Darrell Lea's licorice a try--I don't think you'll be sorry.Update: I just bought a bag of the strawberry and it ROCKS; it's even better than the green apple.

Both sauces brought out the ""broiled/grilled"" flavor of the chicken and made it taste hotter and more intense.However, hubby was underwhelmed by the red hot sauce. ""I can taste the vinegar,"" he said, which is not a compliment. He said it was too simple, like the kind you'd whip up in the kitchen on the spur of the moment when you want some ""hot sauce.""

They don't taste just like a peanut butter cookie, but they do have a wonderful flavor which I found surprising given the ingredients.  I love that there is no added sugars.  One bar makes me feel great after I eat it, and there is no sugar crash later on.  With protein and fiber, it's a great choice.  Also, it's gluten-free and dairy-free for individuals who cannot consume either of those two things.I highly recommend!",5,Simply Delightful,1336348800

Unlike other brands I have tried, these turn out great...no off flavor or unwanted crunch. My understanding is that oven ready noodles are precooked at the factory and dehydrated. The sauce rehydrates them during baking and the end result is a flavorful noodle that is not gummy. Covering the pan seems to help soften them. Thinner than traditional noodles, these are flat and smooth not  pleated like other no boil products. Be generous with the sauce.

This snack food, FoodShouldTasteGood Multigrain chips really is a good tasting, good for you snack.The ingredients are listed on this page and you can see that there are no hydrogenated oils, no high fructose corn syrup and no MSG.  They contain grains that are visible in the chip and a one ounce serving gives you 3 grams of fiber.  (The packaging doesn't specify if it is soluble or insoluble.)The chips are delicious.  They are thicker than what you would expect in a normal corn tortilla chip; more like a cracker in thickness but with the crunch of a chip.  The flavor is similar to a popular name brand corn chip (Fritos) only without the added fat.  I can see where some people say they have a stale taste - there is a grain that has a mild nutty flavor in the chip that you don't expect to taste in a corn chip.  I recommend the multigrain chip if you are hungry for a salty snack that won't blow your diet and that leaves all the unhealthy junk out.

This blend is described as a ""medium to dark"" roast and that is exactly what it is. Colombian Coffees are most often ""Medium Roast"" and I find this had a bit more flavor with the darker roast. The price is certainly good - if you either have Prime Shipping or combine order to go over $25.00 for free shipping. Otherwise the shipping cost raised the ""net price"". Note that bags are 12 ounces so currently it is about $9.50/lb.I was quite happy with it but - like fellow reviewer E. Barron, I dropped a star because none of my bags was vacuum sealed (there were 3 in package) and when I opened (at least the first) one there was no strong coffee fragrance, as in past CC bags. The bags were all marked to use ""before 12/31/13) which is 7 months from when I received it, though I don't know when packed.So, the coffee is made from Aricaba Beans and certainly higher quality than Maxwell House or Folgers. I might order it again if I have an order that provides free shipping.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,Good value in a medium-dark roast but my bags had lost their vacuum seal.,1369353600

Like most everyone I grew up going to a Dr. And getting prescriptions when something was wrong with my health. I have hypoplasia...breast constriction,  and my Dr.s wouldn't prescribe me metformin which is a medication that promotes lactation because apparently breastfeeding isn't a high priority for him. I was told to give up breastfeeding...that it was too much for me to be doing (pumping and supplementing via a sns) especially with all the contributing factors (my son had tongue tie and bit me until i looked like a burn victim and therefore transferred almost no milk which made him frustrated and bite more) and that I'd b stuck with my low supply... 4 oz a day. Well I got a hospital grade pump, got this tea and more milk plus special blend capsules and in a month I am at 17 oz and climbing.

42970,A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,B0019F30J8,Timothy B. Riley,"When I first received my order of the Italian Dressing mix, I was a little wary. A lot of prepared herb and spice mixes on the market seem to be full chemicals that I can't pronounce and they taste very dull, extremely salty and have a strange, artificial after-taste. NOT THIS ONE!When my order arrived the first thing that I did was to taste the mixture straight out of the jar. I was surprised at how clean and fresh the taste was. I picked up on the herbs (I'm thinking oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary and maybe some mint), the sea salt and then the sweetness of the bell pepper combined with a tartness of the lemon juice. There was a slight bit of heat (the garlic?) and a nice, pure, food-like aftertaste.Next I mixed it with some fine olive oil and used it as a dip for some crusty Italian bread. Wonderful! Later in the week I used it, along with some Dijon Mustard, as a coating for a rack of lamb. I ended up adding a little crushed black pepper to the mix and it was great.Finally I used it as a salad dressing along with aged balsamic vinegar, wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. It took a few minutes to get the proportions right, and I did add a little chopped rosemary and some fresh minced garlic. It was much better than any prepared dressing that comes in a bottle.I was really impressed with the flavor and quality of this prepared mix, so much so that I ordered this variety pack.  Here are my thoughts on the other two varieties that come with this set:*  French GardenAt first taste it seemed salter than the Italian version.  The chives not only tasted fresh but still retained their classic oval shape (meaning that they were not over-processed or ground to death).  The garlic and onions were strong, but not too.  I also picked up on the parsley and I thought I tasted a little tarragon.  I added this mix to a French style omelet (runny).  Very nice!  My fear of it being too salty was put to rest.  I next sprinkled it on some grilled eggplant and I was blown away!  It woke up the subtle flavors of the vegetable.  I will be trying this is other dishes to be sure.*  Napa GardenThis mix had a different texture than the others, probably due to the tomato powder which added a wonderful richness to the blend.  This one was not as salty as the other two.  The pepper gave it a little heat but I usually like more (which is easy to add, hard to take out). I tried this (along with some olive oil) with spinach angel-hair pasta.  That turn out to be a good choice.  The mix did not overwhelm the flavor of the pasta but added that extra kick.I highly recommend this variety pack.  All three will become staples in my spice cabinet.",5,A Must Have for the Foodies Spice Cabinet,1212710400

It doesn't compare, however, to sodas that it will probably have more direct competition from such as Sunkist, the numerous Fanta flavors and others.  Why?  Because when most folks want a soda, they want a sugar-laden treat that'll give them a little spark.  This is soda for folks who care a bit more about their health than the average joe.  It's also a good choice for people who may not be able to drink sugar-shockers like Cherry Coke.I'm not saying that Izze Sparkling Juice is bad.  In fact, it tastes pretty good.  It contains seventy percent fruit juice (and most of that is white grape and apple) and thirty percent sparkling water.  The sugars that are contained in this drink are all natural.  It's also got a few vitamins in there, which are a plus.The pomegranate juice has a bit of a tart bite to it, and in my opinion the lemon juice that's also contained in this drink stands out a bit.  The can is 8.4 ounces, so you won't be getting the usual twelve ounces from the average can of soda.  Be sure to drink it very cold, because much like Miller Lite, it's pretty rank when it's warm or just a tad cool.In closing, Izze's got a good thing going with their sparkling juices.

Packaged like regulard Graham crackers, they taste very similar as well. Though, there's a slight after taste that goes away after eating a few. The ingredients are simple enough: graham flour (whole grain wheat flour), whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, safflower oil, honey, raisin paste, brown rice syrup, leavening (baking soda and monocalcium phosphate), sea salt, cinnamon, and Vitamin E to help protect flavor. There are no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors. So, the crackers do taste slightly different from the name brand graham crackers, but lacking the unhealthy preservatives. There are 110 calories per serving, and serving size is 2 full cracker sheets. The picture on the box does not do the cracker justice, making the crackers look bland and dry. Just as the name brand, these crackers are sweet enough to be called cookies and satisfy my sweet tooth. Yet, they're a healthy snack choice. I highly recommend this brand of whole grain, all natural graham crackers. I'm definitely hooked.",5,Hooked on Whole Grain,1298505600

If you follow the directions for the dressing, the dressing turns out slightly more watery than most bottled ranch dressings, so you might want to add less milk but that's strictly a matter of personal preference.Overall, I like this product.

When I found this mix, it was like a gift from God. I've since tried several other mixes, but none turned out as consistent a product as this mix. I do make some tweaks, however. I add a packet of unflavored gelatin (increases the protein content and helps with texture) and a teaspoon of xanthan gum. Often I will use my own yeast, just to make sure it's fresh. With these tweaks, I can easily make very good bread--without a bread maker (I have one, but I get much better results without it). I do find that I have to double the cooking time, but that could be from our area's temp and humidity and our oven.I've occasionally tried some variations, such as raisin and cinnamon, poppyseed, etc., with varying results. Overall, however, this is so much better than the awful pre-made, mass-produced shelf-stable breads, better than other mixes, and as good as many of the local freshly-baked GF breads that sell for eight dollars a loaf in our area. My son still likes his frozen bread for some sandwiches, but otherwise we often make this.Amazon's subscription-price is competitive, so we'll move to that!Updated to add that I no longer add xanthan gum to the mix, and the results are just as good.

Indeed, my impression from the internet is that chia pudding (made with almond milk, soy milk, or water) is most popular among vegans, and is essentially used as ""vegan yogurt"".  But, if you aren't vegan, your chia pudding doesn't have to be vegan.  Chia pudding made with milk is tasty and appealing, particularly with fruit.MY RECIPE> For a thin yogart-like texture 2 tablespoons chia.  For pudding-like texture, 3 tablespoons chia.1 cup milk.  This can be cow milk, probably even half-and-half, but vegans use almond milk, soy milk, or even coconut milk.  Other reviewers claim that fruit juices can be used.> 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoons vanilla.> 1 teaspoon sugar (or agave, honey, etc.) to taste.  Stevia works well if you want to minimize the sugar.Kal Pure Stevia Extract Powder -- 3.5 oz> Mix and chill overnight.  The easiest way is to use a container with a tight lid so that you can shake it once an hour for the first several hours, so that the chia seeds fully hydrate.PS: EASY TAPIOCA PUDDING.  My research on the internet revealed that tapioca pearls and pudding are two different things.  Pudding (of any kind) is simply starch.  For a 2-cup pudding mix, use 1/4 cup of tapioca pearls which have been soaking in dairy, soy or almond milk for at least 3 hours.  If you use a vanilla or coconut pudding mix that you cook until it thickens, cook the hydrated tapioca pearls with the mix.  Tapioca pearls in a vegan pudding would be vegan.Bob's Red Mill Tapioca, Small Pearl, 24-Ounce Units (Pack of 4);Jell-O Cook & Serve Pudding & Pie Filling, Coconut, 3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24);Bird's Custard Powder 300g.  Coconut pudding and Bird's Custard mix contain no eggs, and so would be vegan, if made with soy or almond milk.",5,Chia Pudding,1379462400

I personally never like Tabasco, and feared that this would be similar, but it is its own flavor and that flavor is great! This sauce has a flavor similar to a Taco Bell Hot sauce.  It has a kick to it, but is not too potent where it is hard to take.  It has a kick to it, but you will not be in pain and will find it adds a significant taste to whatever you add it to (I like it in Quesadillas and on tacos).  It adds a nice flavor that is not overpowering but gives it a kick.In the end this hot sauce has an excellent flavor that adds to any dish.  It reminds me of a Taco Bell hot sauce and is super good.  It is hot, but not too overpowering where it is uncomfortable to eat.  I really like this sauce and enjoy tossing a few splashes on tacos and Quesadillas.

So for example, I think the nutritional value is paramount, whereas someone else may only care for taste.I think it's awesome that this is a sweet and small portioned snack. We don't always want to snack on fruit, veggies or nuts, so it's good to be able to switch it up.  With that said, the 18 grams of sugar is really too much for such a small serving. In looking at the ingredients, there are 3 sugars named: brown sugar ( the first listed ingredient), sugar  and then corn syrup.The reason why this is not ideal (for my family and I) is that after you get that sugar high and then crash, you're most likely gonna want to grab another bag or another snack.With regards to the flavor itself, I would have prefered it without the fudge deluge (can't call that a drizzle). The caramel is plenty sweet on its own and has good flavor.All in all, if they come out with a non fudge version with a lighter coating of caramel it would be a win for me.

2257,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B00DDT116M,Sneaky Burrito,"I had been wanting to add matcha to my smoothies, but when I looked for it at Whole Foods, it was SO expensive that I gave up on that idea.  Turns out, I was looking at ""ceremonial"" grade, which is the expensive stuff typically used for drinking.  This product I'm reviewing, however, is ""culinary"" grade and is intended to be used for cooking.  It still contains a lot of antioxidants but is much more affordable.  (The health benefits of green tea are established.  But not all of the antioxidant compounds are water-soluble so simply drinking tea won't get you the full benefit -- you need to consume the powder, as well.)This is a pretty green color.  It's not quite as bright of a color as the ceremonial grade would be, but if you are buying this to use in recipes (which is what this product is intended for), you will be mixing this with other ingredients anyway.  It comes in a resealable pouch.First, I tried this in a smoothie (with the juice of beets, carrots, celery, and oranges, plus raw cacao powder, hemp or chia seeds, bananas, and mixed berries).  I could taste the tea in the smoothie, but it wasn't overpowering.  It worked pretty well; I think it was aided by the natural sweetness of the fruits, carrots, and beets.Next, I tried this in a muffin recipe.  The muffin batter ended up a muddy green color but the finished muffins were a more natural golden brown with just a touch of green.  Again, I could taste the tea but it worked well with the other flavors.This product came with a PDF e-book cookbook with matcha recipes.  That's where I got the muffin recipe.  The e-book has quite a lot of ideas; the only issue is that I found a few typos (""flower"" instead of ""flour,"" and salt left off an ingredients list but referred to in a recipe, for example).  I won't downgrade my rating based on this, because I was able to figure out what to do, but just be aware of this and pay careful attention to the recipes.  I think you could probably just add a tablespoon or two of this to lots of different recipes.  Don't limit yourself to the ones in the booklet!At any rate, this is an affordable product and appears to be quite high in quality.

I made two cups -- one 10 ounce and one in the recommended size of 8 ounces -- and found that both sizes made a satisfying cup of coffee that stood up to the addition of flavored coffee creamer. For the strongest taste, one should naturally go with the 8 ounce cup size over the 10 ounce. I detected no bitterness or any burnt coffee flavor, as some other reviewers reported. I also was on the lookout for any ""coffee grounds"" left in the bottom of the cup, as some unfavorable reviews indicated I might find -- there were none. As those reviews were done a while back, it is possible that the cups were improved since those reviews were written.

Light-roast coffees such as &#8220;Our Blend&#8221; were new to me, but I'm finding I particularly enjoy &#8220;Our Blend.&#8221; Despite being a light roast, it definitely is coffee, with a very pleasant taste and aroma. Everyone&#8217;s palate is different, of course, but to those of you perhaps wary of a light roast coffee I would say &#8220;Give it a try, it&#8217;s good stuff!&#8221; I&#8217;ll definitely be buying it again, in larger boxes.

I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty.

These have a nice mint hit  and the Xylitol adds a clean, breezy quality that goes perfectly with mint.All of the flavors I've tried have been tasty, but I prefer this one, since I really like mint and it works great for freshening the breath.This product is so truly useful for dental health that I now consider it a must-have as I do my toothbrush, floss, toothpaste, and mouthwash.  I know I can rely on this product to fill in quickly when I need to freshen my breath, and to help keep my teeth clean and healthy if I happen to drink a soda or something between brushings.  Over time I've noticed a lot of improvement in my dental health. Even things like not waking up with a bad taste in one's mouth, and no more sinus problems, are likely due to the beneficial effects of the Xylitol in discouraging problematic bacteria and encouraging beneficial bacteria instead.  The sinus improvement, after about three months of using this product, was the most surprising.  I've only read a little commentary about that, but I can attest that it has worked for me!It is true that these mints are not as rock-hard as products like Life-sav-ors or Altoids etc.  These are compressed tablet-type mints, like Altoids, but they will break up and start dissolving faster.  Who cares?  Actually I've come to appreciate that difference in these mints.  For one thing, it enables you to distribute the product all around your teeth and gums (if you are so inclined).  I do that to help ensure that the product cleans my teeth.  You can actually feel that working as, within a few minutes, any sticky stuff you felt on your teeth from eating or drinking soda etc. will have come off; pretty amazing.  I do typically also use more than one mint at a time; but I did the same thing with Altoids.  I'll usually have around four of them.If you are a mint lover, you might find yourself inclined to eat more than a few at a sitting and, you can without worrying about your teeth!  Or your figure!

There are so many foods/condiments we do eat that already have salt in them, I decided to try this No Salt Substitute in some of my cooking/baking, as well as with meals to use at the table. So far, my family and I have enjoyed our food as we always have, and we did not note a funny flavor (just a slightly different flavor) or any strange aftertaste (which frankly, I expected we might prior to use).Sprinkling it on (baked) french fries is just okay, but I do like that it has a similar consistency (granules) as salt. The fries are better with it than without it, but I think once we have been using this for a while longer, we will all get more adjusted to it. So far, we have used it on fries, chicken and vegetables. Even if everyone opts to use a little regular salt to sprinkle their foods, if I choose to replace this No Salt for the salt I would have normally used for cooking/baking, we will still be healthier for at least replacing some of our regular salt with No Salt. It does not taste just like salt, but it is more palatable than I thought it would be.

I tried the mykcup - it made lousy coffee, but improved with some enhancements - still basically a crapshoot.  I moved on to the Solofill and was thrilled with this for a bit until it started getting clogged and ending up producing half cups of coffee.  I figured this was an issue with too fine a grind but no matter how I ground the coffee, sometimes I would get a full cup and sometimes the water would run so slowly that the Keurig would shut off - producing a half cup of coffee.  Well - I would then run it through twice and it was acceptable but a nuisance.  Next I moved on to the Ekobrew.  So far I think this is the top of the lot.  First, it holds more coffee than the solofill which allows me to make a 12oz cup of coffee instead of the usual 10.  Secondly, the water ran through well and didn't clog - the ekobrew doesn't have the narrow shoot at the bottom (like the solofill) so it doesn't get clogged as easily. It also has a flat bottom - making it easier to fill.  Bottom line - the Ekobrew produced a great 12oz cup of coffee using extra bold medium/fine grind coffee - quickly.

They offered to refund my purchase with no condition or requirement from me. They stated their commitment to putting out a quality product and maintaining their reputation as a quality vendor. Health Works stated they would personally look into what is going on with the batch, and even purchase anonymously to test.I can tell you that that type of response to a customer concern with fast action is RARE nowadays. And I was impressed by it. They had to figure out my email address - it's not like Amazon gives it to them. So, this took resourcefulness. And, they refunded promptly. I had shared my first bag of Health Works Gogi Berries with patients and staff members, and touted them wildly, while educating about what gogi berries did for me. So I was beyond disappointed with the 2nd batch.Now that they've contacted me and voiced their commitment to quality, I will remove them from my 'never buy again' list and watch the reviews here for level of satisfaction before I purchase again. I will also remove the part of this review that refers to the 2nd bag.----> Review below is for the 1st bag &lt;---------I just finished off a bag of these the other day when my replacement back arrived from Amazon (great timing). Before I purchased these, I tried the Sunfood's brand, which I found at my local Whole Foods. They jingled in the bag and I got nearly immediate improvement in my joint inflammation. But that brand is too pricey and 8 ounces was 14 bucks. So I came to Amazon to find a bulk supplier. That's how I found Healthworks.The Healthworks brand was more moist than Sunfoods, and remained effective on joint inflammation. I liked having a bigger back and clipped it based on reviews about the bag not sealing. It is a good value. I did buy a bag of Dragon Herbs' brand with this last bag and will consistently use both. Dragon Herbs Goji is quite a bit more most. I don't know why anyone would blend these, as they are great to eat from the bag or in homemade trail mix. I hear they make a nice soup.

The mango used is the fragrant green and red Central and South American Mango rather than the intensely sweet South Asian Mango.  The sauce is semi-thick and seems to contain a lot of fruit.  There are no arificial ingredients listed on the label.The predominant taste is a sweet honey, then the clean fragrant mango, then a mild hint of Habanero follows.  It is not hot as you would expect from a Habanero sauce. It would be too mild for a hot sauce afficiando, but still too spicy for a novice.  Out of 10 (1 being not hot & 10 being sucicide) this would rank a 2 staright out of the bottle, as the sweetness takes the edge off.  If this sauce were to be used in cooking (heat from cooking increases the hotness of chillies) then this would move up to a 3.5We used this sauce as a glaze over pork kebabs, as a dipping sauce for breaded chicken strips, and to make a sauce base for sauteed shrimp. The flank steak overpowered the clean taste of the sauce and so we added garlic, a half teaspoon of soy sauce and fresh chillies to ""beef up"" the sauce. This gave it a slightly Hawaiian twist.Overall a very versatile sauce than can be easily diluted/strengthened and used in many dishes.  It is worth a try and would make a nice BBQ hostess gift.UPDATE Sept 27, 2009:Over the past few months this has become one of my favourite glazes to use on grilled food.

It is much easier to switch to than a heavier pasta. We barely noticed the change, but unlike plain spaghetti, it does add a little flavor.Compared to Barilla's plain spaghetti, it has slightly more fat (1.5g per serving v. 1g), more sodium (10mg v. 0mg, but still low enough to be negligible), and 6g of dietary fiber v. 2g.

This is the first gf flour blend I have tried.  I didn't want to try the one with fava beans, since fava beans are poisonous to some people and I don't want to find out I'm one of them!  Why do they put that in a baking product with no warning?!?!  Anyway, I decided to bake the choc chip cookies from the recipe on the box last night.  I tasted the cookie dough first and felt it was almost exactly the same in taste, but my husband (the rest of the family is not GF) said it tasted ""a little weird.""  Once baked, the warm, just-out-of-the-oven cookies were beautiful to look at, and they tasted great to me...except that there definitely was a subtle, bitter aftertaste that did not linger.  The texture had a slight grittiness.  My 11-year old said, ""They're okay, but I'm used to the regular cookies.  If I couldn't have regular cookies, I'd be happy with them.""  My 9-year old daughter took a bite, spit it back out, and ran to the sink to rinse out her mouth.  She didn't care for them at all.  My 2-year old happily munched down a couple of bites, then abandoned the cookie.  My husband popped about 5 down the hatch, saying they were a little weird, but that didn't seem to matter enough to stop him from devouring them.  Fast-forward to this morning: I tried them and the ""yum factor"" had definitely gone from ""8"" for me down to about a ""6.5"" with the texture primarily, for they were quite gritty and dry tasting, so the warmer, the better.  However, my 9-year old decided to give them another try since they look so good, and she ate the whole cookie and decided that she likes them after all.  My son is happily munching another one at the moment and likes it, even if it is a bit dry.  That all being said, I'd still buy this mix again for certain baking purposes (like one reviewer suggested - for crumbles and maybe thickening gravies, dredges, etc.).  I think I'll also try the pancakes and waffles.  As we know, nothing is going to be apples to apples with wheat, so I feel I can be grateful for this product as an option in the pantry.

I often make my own soy milk (don't even bother considering anything but the SoyaPower if you decide to go this route). I love edamame. I'm a big fan of Buddhist temple cooking, which uses a lot of soy as meat analog. I love yuba and tempeh and think that kinako is the greatest thing since sliced bread. My idea of heaven is the tofu factory on Mott St. that sells warm tofu custard for a mere 75. Simply stated, I think the humble soybean is a miracle food. In fact, there are only two soy foods that I dislike. One is natto.The other is soynuts.Believe me, I've tried. Plain, salted, barbecue, honey-maple, they're all vile. However, I DO like chocolate, so thought I'd give these a try.They're great.The chocolate is real chocolate, not cocoa and fat, The soynuts are a nice foil because they're crispy (rather than crunchy), so they add texture without much taste of their own.

122,A39F7XOVXQ0LZK,B00DDT116M,Jerry H. Bond,"I am not a Matcha aficionado, however, I've been a health nut for many decades and have researched and tested countless foods and beverages.In addition to 3-day-old broccoli sprouts, red onions, fiber, whey protein and other highly touted health foods, brewed, strong, green tea in bags has been my main squeeze for years.In November 2013, I met a surgeon who is a health nut like myself.  He was raving about the benefits of Organic Matcha green tea.Honestly, I'd never heard of the stuff.As I always do when searching for a product, I went to Amazon, selected the four brands of Matcha that had the best reviews and ordered all four.The hardest part in this process was trying to identify the genuine Matcha aficionados and compare their reviews to those first time heavy drinkers like myself.The green tea in measured, individual cup packets is the one I tried first.  The color was a military OD green.  I saw enough of that ""olive drab"" color in Vietnam to last ten lifetimes.  Besides, getting all the powder out of the packet without spilling it all over the counter was near impossible.  Who wants to clean the kitchen every time they have a cup of tea?I've never been a fan of mystery packages except at Christmas.Green tea packed in unmarked black plastic bags looks like something that came out of a police bust.  A note of apology stating that it was packed this way to save me money doesn't change my mind.If EMS has to come into my home for an emergency, I don't want an over zealous EMT to observe the kitchen counter and then radio for a police canine unit.Enough about the losers which I will not even review.If you're reading this review, you already know the winner.The first thing I noticed about this Organic Matcha Green Tea Powder was the bright Kermit-green color.It looked like someone had skinned Kermit and run his rawhide through an industrial blender for hours.  The ultra-fine powder matched the color on the package perfectly.Don't you hate buying food in a package that's supposed to match the color of the food and you get a food of an entirely different color?The extremely fine powder did not clump as did some of the other brands.I add a rounded teaspoon in a 20-ounce mug and pour hot water over it and stir vigorously for about 30 seconds.  A delicate green froth forms on top that leaves you with a Kermit-colored mustache.There are dozens of ways to sweeten but I like mine straight.All tastes are acquired.  The more I drink this tea the more I crave it, especially after a meal.From what I can ascertain, there is no difference in antioxidants between culinary and ceremonial grades of Matcha.The experts claim the ceremonial grades have a slightly smoother taste which only trained tongues can detect.My tongue is untrained.  It will accept fine wine in a Dixie Cup.  Why would I pay $400.00 a pound when my tongue won't know the difference?The customer service offered by Kiss Me Organics is unmatched.  They respond to questions almost immediately and go above and beyond to keep their customers satisfied.They are a ""happy place"" to shop.If you're searching for a Matcha,  select whatever suits you the best and then enjoy it in whatever way pleases you most.I also did a bit of research on storage containers and wasted a few bucks in the process.On Amazon.com, you'll find this item:CorningWare French White 20-Ounce Mug.The price as of 01/15/14 is $6.97.Most utility products I buy today require some kind of modification.  This mug is no exception.  The many negative reviews on this mug all point to the extreme difficulty in removing the lid.  The problem is the earflap closure tab. It's too darn big.  Here's the solution:Keeping the same contour, cut about 1/2-inch of the earflap off on both sides with a pair of scissors.  The plastic is very easy to cut.  If you still have difficulty opening the lid, shave off another 1/4-inch from each side of the earflap. This alteration does not diminish the integrity of the lid.There is a blue tab on top of the lid with a straw hole in it. Open this tab, snap the lid into place, press down on the lid and then snap the blue tab into place.  You have a vacuum seal for your Organic Matcha...and it is easy to open.I only add one 4-ounce bag of Organic Matcha at a time even though the mug will hold 8 ounces.With all this having been said, only one more point remains:Every doctor, physical therapist and personal trainer I've ever met will tell you that the most important thing for a healthy and energetic life is (you will sneer and hate me after I say this)EXERCISE.The more strenuous the better.Live long and healthy and enjoy life.",5,"LIVE LONG, HEALTHY AND ENJOY LIFE.",1389744000

It's not great, it's not awful, it just sort of is. The candy itself is shaped like tiny pebbles - about half the size of a Tic Tac - and all the ones we have had are a bit softer than traditional hard candy. The flavors are supposed to be Berry, Citrus and Fruit, but honestly, I had to look up what the individual flavors were supposed to be. The candies just taste sweet and sort of vaguely reminiscent of artificially flavored medicine.If these weren't supposed to be good for your teeth or diabetic-friendly, I can't imagine anyone bother to seek them out. My daughter, who is nearly two and horrible about brushing her teeth, was my inspiration for seeking out xylitol candies. I figured they would be a good treat in lieu of traditional sugar-based sweets. (Another reviewer was concerned about the size of the candies for young children - unless your kid is just learning to eat and you are concerned about aspirating food, I doubt it would be a problem. These aren't choking size; they'd be swallowed whole.) She likes them well enough, though if given the choice we both prefer the taste of Ice Chips Real Lemon.I should mention, too, that if you are just trying xylitol sweetened candies, please start slowly. They can cause digestive upset if too much is eaten. With these, we haven't had any problems, but we also consume them pretty sparingly, with one tube lasting us a week or two.Overall, though I won't be tossing the ones I bought, I won't be buying Xlear again.

I consume lots of apple cider vinegar and I have come close to even purchasing Vitacost apple cider vinegar many times but for only some $.20 cents difference with Bragg and Dynamic it is difficult to ignore ingredients, labelling and nutrition facts. Dynamic specifies New York apples, Bragg does not so Vitacost but Bragg has been around for long time and no one knows, Vitacost may infact be Bragg or Dynamic since Vitacost subs everything out by placing their labelling but nowhere on Vitacost Internet site or anywhere on the bottle it specifies RAW and UNFILTERED apple cider vinegar on Vitacost brand. Not a buy when I can get the best with those wordings specified on the labelling. Sorry Vitacost.Apple cider is beneficial for conditions that can increase any signs of Gerd which may include Obesity, Hiatal hernia, Pregnancy, Smoking, Dry mouth, Asthma, Diabetes, Delayed stomach emptying. I insure to consume apple cider with water+grounded cloves before my workouts within the same time that I consume my power drinks with different seeds that I ground. Only USDA approved apples, produced in US, in glass not plastic container, organic, raw, not pasteurized, not heated, not filtered. Pasteurized is worthless since just like any type of pasteurized juice regardless of the fruit, vegetable, etc. lose nutritional values. This is apple nothing else, nothing more. Apples are a healthy part of my diet and apple cider is a convenient way of getting my daily organic apples rather than making a trip to grocery store on daily basis. Although refrigeration not a requirement, I refrigerate. I use a straw when consuming so I would avoid getting the mix on my teeth as much as possible and make sure to rinse after since vinegar can be very damaging to teeth enamel. No brushing for couple of hours till saliva has dissolved any trace of the vinegar.HAIR: For no shampoo and conditioner to cleanse my hair I use no shampoo mix at all, since I make my own shampoo and conditioner. For shampoo I mix water+baking soda, half and half, cold boiled water AND water+organic apple cider, half and half, cold boiled water for conditioner. I do not mix in advance but mix just before jumping in shower. Need to keep it out of eyes completely. It takes few uses for hair to get used to it but the results are amazing. Now that process takes time and effort. For less effort, I mix 2 part organic castor oil, 2 part organic apple cider vinegar and 6 part shampoo. No conditioner, no more of anything other than the mix and sometimes I even add some EVOO or Wheat Germ Oil which is the highest in vitamin E. The effects are so immediate that after applying the mix I feel the effects on my hair immediately in the shower. I insure to mix a little at a time and always rinse hair with coldest water possible since it adds volume unlike warm water which destroys volume, but shampoo it with warm water. Tweak the mix according to the type, color and length of the hair but always insure to keep the mix away from eyes and scrub the mix on the scalp for the benefits of castor, apple cider on scalp and removal of any residue on hair. I do not shampoo my hair every single day since it damages hair and the natural oil of the hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but castor oils omega-9 fatty acids can help. Can apply the oil on the whole scalp for few minutes or before washing it off completely with apple cider vinegar.According to CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY ***A little-known use of antibiotics has quietly been allowed in organic apple and pear orchards. Most organic consumers believe that antibiotics are prohibited in organic food production systems, which is mostly true, since all other uses were outlawed when ""organic"" became a federally regulated program in 2002. Yet, the use of the antibiotics tetracycline and streptomycin, commonly used to treat human and animal infections, in apple and pear growing have been the exception.

5448,A3IMO49QD6OYKN,B005KK56JU,D. A. Ross,"Let's be honest: there are few desserts that can compete with a fresh baked, chewy oatmeal cookie. Even better when it's oatmeal raisin! As such, I was somewhat skeptical of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I'm generally let down by store-bought cookies. Well, I'm here to tell you, I have become a believer. I have seen the light! Here's a breakdown of what I think overall:TEXTURE:The package says ""soft-baked,"" and brother, it is no lie. These cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. Though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.SERVING SIZE:At 42g, these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. It would take 3 Oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. No contest.TASTE:Dynamite. Sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.NUTRITIONAL PROFILE:Now, this is where Quaker loses a few points with me. Though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it's probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. But, each cookie does contain 4g of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and 2g protein! For those who are curious, here's the complete nutrient breakdown:Serving Size: 1 Cookie (42g)Calories: 140Total Fat: 6g (9%)Saturated Fat: 1.5g (8%)Polyunsaturated Fat: 1gMonounsaturated Fat: 3.5gCholesterol: 15mg (5%)Sodium: 150mg (6%)Total Carbohydrate: 27g (9%)Dietary Fiber: 4g (16%)Sugars: 12gOther Carbohydrate: 11gProtein: 2gIngredients: Whole Grain Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Bleached and Unbleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Raisins, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Whole Wheat Flour, Palm and High Oleic Canola Oil (with TBHQ [preservative]), Fructose, Invert Sugar Syrup, Mid-Oleic Sunflower Oil, Raisin Paste, Inulin, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil*, Honey, Brown Sugar Molasses), Dried Eggs, Modified Corn Starch, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Oat Fiber, Propylene Glycol Mono- and Diesters of Fat and Fatty Acids, Mono- and Diglycerides, Soy Lecithin, BHT [to preserve freshness], Citric Acid [to preserve freshness], Wheat Gluten, Molasses, Calcium Phosphate, Salt, Natural Flavor, Cinnamon, Allspice, Corn Starch, Enzymes. *Adds a Dietarily Insignificant Amount of Trans FatPACKAGING:Stellar! Each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid's lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.COST:From what I can tell, the Quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. Based on Amazon's pricing as I write this, the cost is slightly less than $1.00 per cookie. Not bad!OVERALL:If you're looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can't do much better than Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies. The only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass.",4,Guilty pleasure or guiltless treat?,1343088000

28152,A3EK2KTYHJCPB9,B004E4HUMY,Brian R.,"In our house we typically only drink brewed iced tea.  Mio is good in a pinch, or if you're not too awfully picky about the taste, but obviously it's an artificially sweetened and flavored type of mix.  Therefore, you'll still get some of the weird aftertaste, but overall, it's not too bad.  It didn't have that sharp taste like some of the ones coming from a fountain soda machine, which I did appreciate.  Sweetness was balanced with the intensity of the tea flavor such that it wasn't ""deep southern"" iced tea, which seems to favor sweetness over tea taste.I liked it as did my daughter.  My son liked it, but didn't want a second glass.  My wife didn't like it at all, and she's the biggest tea drinker and probably most taste-sensitive.",4,Better than some other instants,1329091200

I still buy some of my favorite k-cups as a treat, but for the most part I buy pre-ground coffee and use a filter similar to these. The cups are simple to use; fill with your favorite pre-ground coffee, close the lid and pop into your Keurig. One of the reasons you'll want to use pre-ground coffee is that it will have a consistent grind and will brew better than if you grind it yourself in a commonCoffee Grinder.  The only exception is if you have a grinder like theMr. Coffee Automatic Burr Mill Grinder, which will give a consistent grind. TheMelitta E-Filtersays each filter is good for up to 20 uses.

After a few sips I emptied the can into my sink.These energy drinks are a cancer to our health. They're just caffeine and sugar -- it's as unhealthy as soda, but advertised as ""All Natural"" to convince people there are health benefits to drinking it, or at least, it won't adversely effect your health. Whether the sweetener is ""natural"" or high-fructose corn syrup, it's still loaded with calories.Let's analyze the nutrition facts:There are 90 calories in each 8.4 ounce Crisp Apple can. That's 10.7 calories per ounce. A 12 ounce can of Coca-Cola classic has 140 calories or 11.67 per ounce. So Jamba's Crisp Apple has about as many calories per serving as Coca-Cola. But wait, there's more!A can of Crisp Apple has 20g of sugar or 2.38g per ounce. Coca-Cola Classic has 39g per 12 ounce can or 3.25g per ounce. So again, Jamba is only marginally more healthy than Coca-Cola Classic.If you're looking for a caffeine jolt without all of this sugar and calories, you're better off drinking black coffee or espresso (1 ounce of espresso contains 51.33mg of caffeine; Crisp Apple has only 9.5mg per ounce -- so a 1.5 ounce shot of espresso will provide the same amount of caffeine minus the sugar and caloires).",1,Vile Tasting; About as Unhealthy as Soda,1301443200

Kellogg's, maker of Frosted Flakes, introduced this new Crunchy Nut cereal in 2 forms.  This type is a flaked, sugar-coated cereal with tiny chunks of peanuts on the flakes themselves.  Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut has two layers of flavor.  The primary flavor is exactly like Frosted Flakes, and the cereal has the same shape and even similar texture and sugary glaze.  The secondary flavors would, according to the name of the product, supposedly taste like honey and nut, but what I taste the most is molasses.  That is an ingredient in the cereal, as is sugar, honey, and corn syrup.  Lot of forms of sugar in this cereal.  Despite having honey in it, I notice no honey flavor at all.  There was another, harder to identify taste which was I finally realized was peanut, but it was overwhelmed by the other sweet flavors.  Despite little peanut bits on the flakes, it didn't immediately taste peanutty to me.  Overall, the molasses flavor left a weird aftertaste that I did not find pleasant.  These weren't flakes I could eat right out of the box, as milk was necessary to tone down the powerful, almost cloying taste.

My wife and I try to eat as healthy as possible, so this cereal appealed to me since I've had similar cereals by other brands. I think this is a far superior product than many others I've tried.The flakes in this cereal are very thick and very crunchy. They maintain their crunch even after sitting in milk for about five minutes. The flakes are coated in flavoring, and the primary flavor is honey. It's a pleasant honey flavor -- not bitter and not too sweet. The box claims that vanilla extract is used -- although I can only taste the slightest hint of vanilla. Overall, the flavor is good and after eating a bowl, there's only a slight honey aftertaste.It's important to note that this cereal contains dried strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries. The raspberries and blackberries are typically whole, while the strawberries are halves, quarters, or just pieces. They hydrate when they sit in the milk, and they have a good texture -- and they don't fall apart. Unfortunately, the quantity of berries is low -- expect about less than 5% by volume per box. When you pour a bowl of cereal, you might get 2 or 3 berries in the bowl, per 1-cup serving.From a nutritional standpoint, I'm satisfied but there is room for improvement. The calorie content is slightly higher than I expected -- 210 calories per 1-cup serving. Depending on what type of milk you use, a single-serving can be 250-300 calories. Fat content is only 0.5g.  Carbohydrates are somewhat on the high-side: 46g total per cup, with 5g of dietary fiber (20% for a 2,000 calorie diet). I attribute the high carb content to the sugars -- the flakes contain ""malted barley syrup"", ""evaporated cane juice"" and ""molasses"", while the second overall ingredient listed is ""brown sugar"".  If they could cut back on the sugar content, this product could be perfect.Overall, this is a quality product that I enjoy. I would not eat this every day, but it is good 2 or 3 times per week. Great flavor and texture, but just a few too many calories for me to enjoy every day.",4,"Good flavor, very crunchy -- but light on berries",1230768000

The bad news (besides the price) is that it breaks very easily; I'm not kidding.  Also, it can get stale pretty quickly and lose all of its merits in the process.Our daughter used to be on a much stricter gluten- and dairy-free diet, and these came in handy at the time - she liked them slathered with mayo and sliced smoked turkey.  But now that her diet has broadened, there are other starch and carbo sources she likes more, and we no longer have quite the need to shell out the expense for these.

Maybe this bag was a fluke -- it got exposed to high heat in transit or something in processing went wrong or perhaps it encountered a Gamma Death Ray of alien origin.

No matter what, it turns bitter and astringent. I suspect another reviewer is right and the jasmine flavor is chemically enhanced. There are a lot of great reviews here and it is statistically impossible that this many people just have no idea what good jasmine tea should taste like, so I have to take your ratings at face value. But know this, Numi is perfectly capable of sending you a bag of terrible tea and you will pay a pretty steep price for that. I shall not reorder.

Unlike the common alternatives, this doesn't require refrigeration, much less freezing, so it's a good deal more convenient to use especially for those who have found their frozen lunches disappear from the common use refrigerator.The heavy plastic packaging is, with the exception of the film, wholly recyclable.The product comes in a 9 oz or about 250 g package consisting of separate compartments for both the pasta and sauce. To prepare, you peel the sealing film from the sauce area, nuke / microwave for one minute, peel the rest of the sealing plastic off and then pour the sauce over the cooked pasta. The one minute time worked perfectly in the 1100 watt oven I used but may be insufficient if you have a 700 watt unit.The only glitch in preparation is that the film is somewhat difficult to remove which may be a factor for those with weaker  hands or arthritis especially since the majority of the removal is done after the product is hot and steaming. I'd not like to get splashed by the hot sauce due to a struggle to get the film off after cooking was done.I rate the taste as above the frozen competition. The pasta is al dente rather than mushy and the sauce has a nice acid tang to it. Both are a pleasant upgrade from the usually bland offerings from the frozen world much less the often dreadful choices you have canned or freeze dried.The only downside I can see is the serving size. This may be satisfying for most folks, but it was on the smaller size for me. That is, a bit too little for lunch or dinner but a good deal too much for a snack.

I've sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea, when compared to the others, is nothing spectacular.  When unbrewed, the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed.  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible. Additionally, there was a strange aftertaste with this tea.  It just wasn't pleasant.If you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage, your choices will be limited. I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base.  However, if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body, I would recommendChocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea, which is a naturally caffeine free tea.  Zhena's chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate, but it has a lot of spices.  Still,Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Teahas a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut tea.If you don't care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea, there are several others that I would recommend before this one.  They include:Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea,SerendipiTea ChocolaTea, Chocolate, Vanilla, Rooibos & Black Tea, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2), andBigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea, 1.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6).

This little kitchen miracle worker makes baking so much easier and healthier.  No more having to grease cookie sheets or clean up the mess from a pecan pie that ""bubbled over"" when cooking.  A piece of parchment paper does the trick while keeping unecessary fats and calories out of your foods!The one problem with parchment paper is the variety you find in most stores is 1)  Expensive and 2)  bleached with chemicals.  ""If You Care"" has solved both of those problems in this 4-pack of parchment paper that your kitchen will love (hint:  it also makes a GREAT gift for a friend who is into cooking -- trust me!).  For the price you will pay for 4 boxes of this parchment paper you will get over 8 times as much as you would have gotten in the grocery store!  Plus you can rest easy knowing you aren't harming the environment by using paper that was bleached (can someone tell me what the purpose is to bleaching parchment paper -- it just seems silly!)I can't stop recommending this paper enough.  This is my 4th purchase from Amazon over the years of this exact same paper and while you may think that 4 boxes is a lot -- trust me, it will get used!

16338,A1FDVT0DLJWV78,B002IEVJRY,D. A. J.,"I am an iced coffee (particularly mocha flavored) connoisseur. No, I am really, really serious about it! Not the coffee shop $5 a piece kind - the ones you buy in glass bottles or cans. When I say ""connoisseur"", I mean drinking one almost every day for the past eight years kind of connoisseur. Having stopped drinking one popular brand, and not being able to find a substitute - I ended up resorting to blending my own. However, this completely killed the portability that I loved, as well as the ability to grab one our the fridge and head out the door.Then I was asked to try this brand. Let me just say I am immediately putting this on ""subscribe and save"" for a monthly delivery.What makes it good is its balanced flavor. You know you are drinking coffee, not chocolate milk someone put into a used coffee cup. Not black coffee some tried to flavor a bit too late with a sugar bomb. This drink is well blended and the flavors are well balanced.While I absolutely appreciate they kept calories down (100 calories a serving) - I think they accomplished this by using quite a few ""ingredients"", many I needed to look up to see exactly what they were. While they don't sound life threatening, it makes the list of ingredients twice as long as a Starbucks Frappuccino in a glass bottle (although it does have 80 less calories than the Starkbucks brand at only on ounce less drink per can)coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, carrageenan. Caffeine content: 81 mgSo, if you are a person who really doesn't like a lot of chemicals or funky science going on in their food - you may be tempted to skip this one. There are other drinks one doesn't need a chemistry degree to ingest.With that said, the taste is smooth and balanced. I new I was drinking coffee - although it had the chocolate and milk flavors that I crave as well. I didn't get the shakes from too much caffeine and the price is reasonable compared to what you would pay in your average grocery store for similar products. Like I said, I am putting it on subscribe and save. However, I will probably still be on the lookout for iced coffee products that use more natural ingredients. It really is a good tasting product!Also, for those curious. This is a Cocoa-cola product that is a product of Denmark.",4,"Nice, smooth flavor",1332374400

34643,A2XKJ1KX6XUHYP,B00485GY1M,NYFB,"Navitas is a good brand. I purchased this for my friend since she does not want to go through the process of grinding. If grinding is an issue, then this is the next best option, only if it is from a reputable brand but rancid is a serious issue with all flax seeds regardless of the brand, regardless organic or conventional...OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr.",3,Will Go Rancid...,1382313600

I don't normally buy the sort of ""ready-made"" tea that comes in individual serving size bottles.  I also don't usually care much for green tea.  Despite all that, when I saw this product, I just had to try it.  I was really intrigued by the bits of aloe vera, something I've never eaten before.  So, I went ahead and ordered one.First off, I really like pulpy drinks (like the Sac Sac Grape Pulp Drinks from Asian stores), so I knew that the bits of aloe vera in this drink wouldn't bug me at all.  And indeed, I did enjoy them.  However, if you don't like pulp, you'll really not like this drink.  As for the flavor...  It's not bad.  I've had things that had a bit more interesting flavors to them, but this one is a bit bland/mild tasting.  It's not terrible or anything though, just that I felt like the passion fruit maybe could've been a little stronger.  As for the green tea, I could hardly tell this had green tea in it.  That's great for people who don't like green tea (like myself) but not so great if that was what you were wanting from it.  As for the aloe vera, I'm not sure it really had a flavor at all, as all the bits in here seem to have simply absorbed the flavor from the tea, and thus I can't tell what they would've originally tasted like.  Oh well, the whole thing isn't bad though.As for nutritional content, well, this is mostly sugar and it tastes like the green tea is pretty weak, so I can't pretend that it's terribly healthy or anything.  To be fair, though, the product never claimed to be a health drink.  So, would I recommend this?  Well, I don't know.  I don't really like it enough to want to run out and buy more, but it's not bad, so I guess you'd just have to try one and see if you fall in love with it or not...",4,Not Bad At All...,1330646400

I was fearing that it would TASTE like one of those nasty pumpkin-pie-scented holiday candles, but it doesn't!  Whew.  :-)PROS:- VERY tasty product....yum.  It really reminds me of a seasonal Starbucks pumpkin drink, and get the whole can for the price of one Starbucks drink.- It mixed fully -- no issues of the powder ""settling"" in the bottom of the cup.  No sludge at the bottom of my drink when I'm done!  Tends to stay mixed, with little need to re-stir later.- It makes a nice foam at the top (you can hear something crackling when it first dissolves...kind of funny/intriguing...) ;-)- The taste is great; I have made it with just water, and it it creamy enough for me.  Make it with milk for a really decadent, creamy latte.- It also works well when I use 1/2 brewed coffee and 1/2 this (prepared w/water or milk) -- this mixture tends to kill the foam, but it doesn't affect the taste.  Sometimes I prefer it this way in the morning, both to make a less sweet drink and to extend the yummy pumpkin mix longer!  :-)- You can add more powder to the drink after you decide it's too weak -- with some of these mixes, the newly added powder clumps up and is impossible to mix in...but that's not a problem with this product.  It's very forgiving!CONS: (very few)- It takes some trial and error to get it to the right sweetness -- use a MEASURING teaspoon, not a regular spoon, at least until you get used to how much you'll need.  You don't want to accidentally add too much mix, especially if you're trying to make a specific amount for a travel mug or something.- I seem to need to use a bit MORE than indicated on the directions to really get a nice latte (when I made it with WATER, that is) -- made with milk you can use less mix.- Lots of sugar...but of course, I see this as a treat, so that's not a big concern for me.OVERALL:  I WOULD recommend this to a friend.It has a really lovely blend of flavors -- they got it RIGHT.  Not too strong a pumpkin flavor, not too much spice...just a very nice combination.  And the foam on the top is a nice touch, and doesn't taste fake or weird.I appreciate that it STAYS MIXED, too, as that used to be my pet peeve with these types of instant flavored coffee drinks in the past (you had to ""celebrate the moments of your life"" while stirring constantly/furiously).  ;-)Now I just wish they also made this in decaf for the evenings...  :-)",5,Perfect alone or mixed with regular coffee,1321315200

At first, I was skeptical about using this, but after just 3 days of just having one scoop of this a day in my morning smoothie, I have full energy all day and no naps needed!My morning smoothie are: 1 cup of frozen fruit of any kind, 1 cup of silk soy milk, a cup of non fat yogurt, half a cup of crushed ice (optional), 1 scoop of this powder. Put it in a blender (I use Magic Bullet) to blend for about 30 seconds. Done and yum!! Always looking forward to drinking this every morning.Update: September 2, 2013It's been over a month since I been taking this. I finished the original amazing grass and tried this Berry flavor, which I liked even more. I've been putting this in my berry smoothies every morning. My goodness it's my every day morning breakfast. I can't live without this otherwise I will feel off. One downside is, I seem make a big poop and bucket of pee within the hour after eating this.Update: September 23, 2013Haven't missed a day drinking with this stuff and I haven't felt a day of sleepiness even after hours of intense workout. I noticed that I eat less and feel fuller longer, that I could have this with my yogurt-milk-frozen-berries-smoothie as a meal alone. One night, I had to pull an all nighter for an art piece I was working on. When I had my smoothie, I don't feel that sick icky tired feeling that I usually get if I miss a night sleep. I also feel an extra burst of energy during my workout, that I could exercise an extra hour and lose 7 lbs in less than 2 weeks! God, I love this stuff that I wish I had this when I was in architecture school.Update: October 20, 2013I'm on my second container, haven't missed a day of smoothie, and I still haven't felt a day of groggy or sleepiness. Unless I am working out for more than an hour a day (which I have been doing thanks to amazing grass), I just feel physically tired from the exercise. I now lost 15 pounds since I started drinking this since this helped me stay on 1,200 calorie a day diet. I tried switching to amazing meal chocolate fusion in the morning but it doesn't give me as much energy I get from amazing grass. My only concern is that my body will adjust to it someday, so I will try switching up the flavors so that doesn't happen. I noticed that I poop at least once a day in the morning even before drinking my smoothie. I guess that means my digestive system is quite balanced right now heh.Update: April 26, 2014Although I stopped drinking it for a month to save money (I'm a college student), my mental and my body are in much greater heath. I've lost 9 more pounds since last October. My body may have adapt to it a little as it doesn't help me stay awake after an all-nighter, but still feel much better having this than without. But during the month break of this grass, I sort of felt that grogginess again. Thus I started drinking this again since 2 weeks ago and I am drinking it in my protein shake for my new cardio and strengthening workout routine. It certainly does give that extra needed energy boost for my 2 hour workout that I do 4 - 5 days a week. My endurance increased dramatically that my old friends who started working out with me are very surprised (I was the fat girl always out of shape since elementary school). My skin are still silky smooth and I don't remember any break outs since having this except one pimple during the one month absence. My family been getting illnesses except me. My overall mood have increased and my stress and anxiety management have greatly improved (probably from a combination of working out and taking this).

40945,A3MU1NB6OL01KH,B002YRBATC,This ain't no dress rehearsal,"Yesterday I spent my day in the strawberry patch. I picked eight quarts, and while most of the berries were destined for jam, I made sure to set aside a bowl full of berries to make the first strawberry shortcake  of the season.  Shortcake in our family consists of a generous portion of sugar-sprinkled fruit, a large helping of fresh-whipped cream (sugar and vanilla, too, of course), and all served on top of a still-warm biscuit fresh from the oven that must be made from scratch (Bisquick? Blech.....).  We've only been gluten free for just under two years, and for that time I've neatly avoided, and sorely missed, those homemade biscuits.  Last night I grabbed the  Mama's Almond Blend that had been waiting patiently in my cupboard, screwed up my courage, and made my mother's old fashioned biscuit recipe with it.  Using a fresh-layed egg from one of my hens, baking powder, sweet butter, whole milk, and a small amount of xantham gum, the dough mixed up precisely as it would have had I used wheat-based flour.  The biscuits plopped onto the parchment-lined baking sheet like they always used to, and they baked up golden brown and crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside.  Oh, they were heavenly!  The best part of our dinner aside from the food I was inhaling (and yes, our dinner consisted solely of strawberry shortcake - another family tradition on strawberry picking day) was when my non-gluten-free partner in crime took his first bite, and then looked at me and asked, ""How come you're eating these biscuits?  Aren't you going to get sick?""  He literally could not tell that these yummy treats were gluten free!  I've tried many other gluten free flours in my role as a gluten free product tester, and this one is literally the best I've had.  While other gluten free blends are decent, and can produce the end result many are after, Mama's Almond blend is stellar: texture, taste and results all parallel gluteny flours, and in my recipes Mama's outperforms the rest of the pack of gluten free flours.  My little two pound bag is nearly gone - a batch of chocolate chip cookies this morning proved that it is dollar-to-serving worth its weight (and will significantly increase MINE if I continue to bake and eat like this!); the dough didn't even need to be refrigerated like other gluten free doughs before baking.  I'm one happy camper - and this will be my personal go-to choice for flour from this day forward.  It's a marriage made in gluten-free heaven!  Next up for Mama's Almond Blend - cheddar biscuits to go with homemade chili...and with blueberry season around the corner, and peaches ripening shortly after them, I think I'd better stock up - gluten free summer baking never felt so good!",5,THIS is gluten free??????,1307145600

They are more healthy, don't cause me intestinal issues that gums do, and add a little beneficial fiber to the mix.  They work just well as a binder for batters and doughs, as gums.  This brands of seeds, does, as well.Nutiva produces great products, no question. The seeds have a similar though light flavor than flax seeds. I confess, I am not thrilled about buying seeds pre-milled, as they just don't behave the same. They are drier and don't seem to produce the same consistency of binder when made into a slurry. That said, they do work. I will in the future seek only whole seeds and mill them myself.Another concern is that there is no detailed source information on this product. It states that they are organic, but not that they are gluten-free.

It is refreshing and so delicious, and is also very good in lemonade. I am a trained aromatherapist and as such, am very familiar with the health benefits associated with lavender. I have included some of them below:Lavender is an excellent nerve tonic that may help treat migraines, headaches, anxiety and nervous tension. It is often used for insomnia in smaller amounts; in larger amounts has been used to increase mental activity. Lavender has been used extensively to treat burns and pain associated with sore muscles and joints. It helps restore hormonal balance and may reduce associated menstrual cramping. Lavender is widely used for respiratory ailments, colds, flu and sinus congestion. Added to a beverage, lavender is soothing for sore throats and laryngitis. Lavender stimulates the production of gastric juices and bile and thus aiding in treatment of indigestion, stomach pain, colic, flatulence, vomiting and diarrhea. Regular use of lavender essential oil is said to provide resistance to disease.UPDATE: Bebop Trading Co. is the absolute WORST vendor I have ever dealt with on Amazon. I placed a re-order with them and was very unhappy. They are playing a little game on here by offering the product at $5 and then charging $10 for the shipping.

Many variety packs have a selection of herbals, blacks and green teas. Thankfully Twinings offers us this variety pack of wonderful black teas.The Teas:Irish Breakfast:I love this blend. I have always been a fan of Irish Breakfast. If your new to the tea, don't let the name and green packaging give you the impression there's anything minty about it. It's a straight black tea (typically 100% Assam teas). No sweetness or flavoring of any kind. This is typically taken with sweetener or has milk added to it to taste (like straight black coffee). I personally enjoy it without anything added, and drink it black. Because of it's caffeine content, I prefer drinking Irish Breakfast in the mornings. It also goes great with meals since there are no strong flavors/aromas to overpower the taste of ones food.English Breakfast:Much like the Irish Breakfast tea, it is also a blend of black teas without flavors added. However, there are usually several black teas blended together (most common Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan) to produce the flavor of English Breakfast. The information of the exact leaves blended is not offered as information from Twinings, saying only that it is a blend of black teas, but those are the usually ones. While not as bold as the Irish Breakfast, it is still a strong tea that is typically accompanied by milk or sugar.Lady Grey:A milder version of Earl grey, very subtle citrus flavors have been added to this blend. By no means is this a fruity tea, as it is just a tiny hint of flavor. Not nearly as aromatic as the Earl Grey blend, this Lady Grey has a much more delicate taste.Earl Grey:Bold, aromatic and memorable. Most tea drinkers can pick out a cup of Earl Grey no matter the brand, and Twinings blend is no different. An unmistakable presence of Bergamot can be found, but is not so strong to be off-putting. Fans of Earl Grey will find this a medium strength blend, just enough to know what your drinking, but not the strongest on the market.

I only like it on occasions just to add some flavor, I get eat a pool of mustard on my food though. I was sent some Coleman's Mustard to check out and of course I was expecting the typical squeeze bottle. I was pleasantly surprised to find I was sent a metal can, almost like a pepper can, with powdered mustard. What? They make that stuff?! Yes they do! I never saw it before but it doesn't need refrigeration and you only need to add some water to make the mustard. With the powdered mustard you seem to get more for your money and honestly it tastes just like any other mustard. Of course I would just be aware of the expiration date on your can if you make the purchase. Mine says November 2013 so that leaves me 6 months to use it. If you generally use the product a lot then it's no problem, but for someone like me who uses just a little bit at a time, I need the maximum shelf life to get the most out of it.Overall I have to say I'm rather impressed with the product.

Normally with freeze dried fruit there are plenty of crumbs in the bag.  So you can imagine my surprise to find none.  The flavor is okay.  I would have liked more cinnamon.  Mostly you taste the apples.  A huge plus is that they do not stick to the teeth.  All of the other organic freeze dried fruit snacks that I've eaten over the years tend to stick to my teeth & get gummy as they mix with saliva.  These chew more like potato chips in that they do not get gummy or stick to the teeth.Originally these were not 100% organic, but they improved their ingredients list to 100% organic ingredients.  Please note that while these are not loaded with sugar, they do contain a decent amount.  Obviously the fruit itself contains sugar.  It is the addition of organic apple juice concentrate that really jacks up the sugar content.  The use of any juice concentrate is just a clever way of fooling customers into thinking they are consuming something nutritious in the form of fruit juice when in fact they are consuming concentrate which is not nutritious & just as bad if not worse than sugar cane.  If you are on the SCD diet or need to avoid potatoes please note that they contain organic potato starch.  Obviously in order to keep such perfect firm & crunchy balls these ingredients are required.If you wish to avoid any added ingredients to your organic freeze dried crunchy fruit snacks, I highly recommend the Organic lines of Sensible Foods, Funky Monkey & Just Tomatoes, Etc!

But hey, I'd never tried Krave before, I figured I'd give it a shot. The regular one with chocolate was okay, I liked it better dry than with milk, but I was not a fan of the double chocolate at all. I already love Froot Loops and Apple Jacks, so except for an excessive number of broken loops, no problems there. The Corn Pops were a pleasant surprise. I literally haven't had these in, I'd guess, 18+ years, and from what I remembered, they were very sweet. So either I remember wrong or Kellogg's decreased the amount of sugar in the cereal. I really enjoyed them. Now another con would be the amount of cereal in the pouches. For a snack, there's a reasonable amount, but as a meal, only the Corn Pops provided enough cereal for my usual serving, which is typically what the box recommends (I don't measure, but I can't eat large breakfasts, so my portions are pretty small). The Froot Loops, Apple Jacks, and Corn Pops have seventy calories sans milk, while the Krave's have either 100 or 110. Now if they made all these packs have 100 calorie-servings each, I'd think the portion sizes would be just perfect and practical for people watching their calories while still having a little treat.

2843,A2V89KE32FRZN9,B004NZ0JIQ,"British Mystery Buff ""Reads-a-lot""","I love coffee with chicory and have tried most available blends. The price of CDM coffee and chicory blend in a four-pack with Amazon's Subscribe and Save plan was very attractive and the reason I decided to give it a try. However, as I learned to my regret, it's a bad idea to economize on an untried coffee brand.The taste of CDM coffee is not only disappointing, it's unpleasant. Instead of the robust flavor I associate with other coffee and chicory blends, the word that describes it best is ""bitter."" I now have four bags of a coffee blend I dislike too much to drink. Since coffee and chicory is an acquired taste, and I don't know anyone else who drinks it, I doubt I can even give the stuff away! But I can't bring myself to drink the four bags I bought, so, instead of saving money, I wasted it. I've learned my lesson about trying to economize by buying an untried brand of coffee and chicory:  Don't!In addition to the unacceptable flavor, I was surprised that the plastic pack containing four bags of CDM coffee had three of the vacuum-sealed bags and one of the loose bags. This did nothing to instill confidence in the brand before I even opened one of the bags and brewed a pot of the coffee.I would not recommend this brand of coffee and chicory to anyone who normally drinks a C&C; blend and is discriminating about coffee flavor. If you don't care what your coffee tastes like...the bitter taste that characterizes CDM C&C; may not matter to you.",1,Disappointing bitter flavor,1337126400

Certainly packaged soups are the worst offenders.  Behold Pacific Foods Light Sodium Organic Creamy Tomato.  At long last, perfect balance in a packaged soup.  The tomato flavor, the core issue here, is not only warm and tangy, it's got that little hint of sweetness that only appears in a fresh tomato.  I can't imagine how Pacific Foods does it - you'd swear it was pulled from the vine on a summer's day and magically transported into your mug.  The creaminess is a velvety blanket of affection that surrounds you, yet never overwhelms the tomato flavor.  And while my homemade soups can not stand without the support of chicken stock or beef broth, somehow Pacific Foods has worked even more magic by making this soup completely vegetarian, yet full-dimensional and rich.Now if only Amazon could figure out how to pack the shipment a bit better....  cleaning off 11 cartons because the 12th got bashed in transit - no fun.

I doubt that anyone other than perhaps someone with extreme willpower and self-control (but why!!??) would limit themselves to a 1/4 cup of this wonderful (AND it's organic and NON GMO!) granola.I ate a few handfuls (then a few/many more) -- I put it in a WHOLE (9 ounce) cup and added hot coffee (yumyumyum!) then tried it in a cup of hot water. Then I poured this granola into another cup into which I added cold water -- you get the idea-- I have been eating many servings of Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola (Dark Chocolate and Berries) nonstop all day at my desk in my humble cubicle and it has been a INTENSE and wonderful experience. The only thing(s) I did NOT do were to add cream and then at the next sitting, to add soy (only because they were unavailable - my office mates use that powdery fake ""stuff"") -- but I have NO DOUBT that either addition would have been embraced by the subtle, chocolate-ness and taste-bud-embracing crunchiness of this delightful concoction. Try it atop ice cream with WHIPPED CREAM! Try it in your Yogurt!!!Could I taste the berries? No, not really  -- peering into the bag gave me a good look at them -- they are there -- but I have no doubt that they too contributed to the excellence of this Granola Nirvana.Could I taste the delightful chocolate squares that are interspersed among the chocolate-y graola chunks in this bag? Yes, when eating out of hand they were smooth and melted in my mouth for intense chocolate flavor -- it was almost a sacrilege to pour hot water on them in the cup, but (sigh) for the sake of this review process, I did.I could see the little flax seeds swimming around in there -- and as for the coconut, I could barely taste it, and since I have this small problem with coconut (not really a fan of it), I was very happy to realize that it DID not impact my enjoyment of this granola -- so THAT is GOODAs in any granola, there are alot of calories from fat (55 calories -- about 39% of the total calories are fat). NO Cholesterol, low sodium, some fiber (of course, the coconut and the flax seeds and the oats, maybe even the fruits).Since this Granola was created for a wedding, then the calories should not really be a problem -- for what is a wedding but a joyful occasion where many calories are burned off? So I would suggest that this Granola not only be enjoyed as a breakfast cereal for those who are embarking on the usual stressful commute (think ""run for bus"" ""run for train"" etc etc) but also for lunchbox treats, and definitely camping and hiking. It WILL give your day a Lift.So what's NOT to LOVE about this? Those who have allergies should read the label -- ""contains soy"", and ""produced in a facility that uses dairy, peanuts and tree nuts"".PS-- So why did I not add milk to this LOVElLY Granola? Because I am lactose Intolerant. ""Then why add Cream, Ace?"" you might say. Well, because cream has alot of little fat globs in it and that makes it digest slower -- ergo I rarely have trouble digesting cream (or whipped cream either, to my delight).",5,NO ONE can eat just 1/4 cup of this WONDERFUL concoction!!! &lt;;-D,1330473600

I wasn't so sure the flavor of blueberries would match the taste of coffee. But this product easily exceeded my expectations and I can now see why so many people rave about this coffee. The scent alone is very enticing, with its blueberry muffin- like nose and caramel undertones. The taste is also very nice, with flavors of blueberry, coffee, caramel, and a touch of butter. I appreciate that Green Mountain decided to go easy on the blueberry flavor when they formulated this coffee. Too much fruit flavor would take away from the contributions from the coffee. The balance here is very nice.This coffee product is sweeter than the average brew and it would make a great beverage for a hot breakfast. My experience with this flavored coffee has been confined to the workplace, but I have sampled a cup or two in the mornings when breakfast has been served at my place of employment. The taste is perfectly compatible with most any breakfast food and it made my breakfast even better than usual.I like coffee much more today than I did in the past, and the main reason for my newfound interest is the plethora of flavors offered by so many different manufacturers.

29566,A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,B007P4XRLS,Citizen John,"This 10-gram corked jar is artistic with each of the four sides a different length.  This is dark saffron.  It might be ISO grade 1 (highest grade of the four grades).I use this saffron to make dishes of saffron rice using basmati rice, olive oil, finely minced onion, hot water and a little salt.  The rice turns golden yellow.The taste is as widely described, a kind of metallic-grassy-honey taste that is much better than it sounds.  Saffron's taste comes from its chemical ingredients picrocrocin and safranal.  Saffron has crocin, and that gives its unique golden-yellow coloring to cousine.This is Persian saffron.  Between 90-93% of the world's saffron comes from Iran.  Each saffron flower produces three crimson stigma threads.  I'm guessing it took well over a hundred flowers to produce all the threads in this corked jar that I received.It takes a lot of labor to harvest the threads in this jar.  Minimum wage in Iran is about $303/month, and that's got a lot to do with the relative affordability of this saffron.Whereas I cannot afford the craft saffron produced on microscale levels all over the world, I find the Persian saffron the best deal by far.  Also, Iranian saffron is probably the most intense-tasting saffron in the world.This is a special addition to white or particularly basmati rice, and a wonderful treat for special occasions at home.

10815,A4C0E4KPCIXFY,B00HK6FGIS,Fred Flintstone,"I've read a lot about the benefits (real and imagined) of various herbal compounds. I became curious about several of these compounds, because of some health issues I have experienced (sadly, I keep getting older, so I have to concern myself with these things). I'm not a big believer in superstition and heresay. I really prefer solid evidence. However, I am also sufficiently open minded and willing to try things for myself. What doesn't work for some people, might work for others.That being said, I decided to try Turmeric supplements. The first time I took one, I experienced some major flushing (e.g., I turned bright red), which I suppose is expected. The good news was, Turmeric seems to help alleviate some of the symptoms I was experiencing (I'm being vague because I don't care to discuss my health history for the entire Internet). I later learned that the particular brand of Turmeric I was using, had a hidden California Prop 65 warning sticker on the bottom of the bottle. That really disturbed me. The advertisement on Amazon did not mention this little detail. I decided I would not use that particular brand again. Other customers had also discovered this little fact, as evidenced by their Amazon reviews.So I decided to look for another brand to try. I presume that if a product doesn't have a CA prop 65 warning or sticker on the product, that it doesn't need one (I really am hoping that's true). After searching through the various products on Amazon, I narrowed my choices down to a few brands, including Dr. Danielle's Curcumin. Clearly, there was a significant price difference between what I'd previously purchased, and the other products I was examining. I have to assume that's because the previous product I was using, was somehow deficient or flawed (you can search through my reviews if you're truly curious as to what the other brand was).So I decided to pull the trigger and try Dr Danielle's Turmeric. I was attracted by the fact that this is an organic product, and contains a compound intended to enhance its effectiveness (Bioperine). Apparently this is a special sort of black pepper extract that makes the Turmeric more effective. My education is not in chemistry, so I did a little searching and learned that this Bioperine is a product that can also be purchased alone, for the purpose of enhancing the effectiveness of other compounds. So Dr. Danielle's product is really offering a little extra bang for the buck, as it were, by including this compound in their product. I also noticed that most of the other Turmeric compounds I compared, did not also include Bioperine. It is unclear why that is the case.So earlier this week, I received my bottle of Turmeric, and took one immediately. I noticed that once again I became flushed, which had not happened in quite some time. I don't know if that's because I was taking a compound that was more effective than the other brand I had been using, but I can't really think of any other reason why that would happen. More importantly, I noticed that it helped alleviate my symptoms from (the health condition that I'm not discussing openly). It's not a huge effect, but it is noticeable.So, is it worth the extra effort and cost? I suppose that depends on your point of view. I look at this as a quality of life issue. If I can help improve my quality of life a little, by taking an organic supplement, that other cultures have used for medicinal purposes for a Really Long Time (thousands of years, if you believe Wikipedia), then why not? Yes, it's among the more expensive brands. But it didn't come with a hidden CA prop 65 warning sticker on the bottom of the bottle! Which is a big plus to me. And it's working just as well, if not better than what I had been using before.",5,Best Turmeric Supplement I've tried,1400112000

Dunkin Donuts has started aggressively marketing their coffee in grocery stores and it's nice for a change of flavor.

I can enjoy coffee whether it's mild and smooth or dark and pungent.  The main problem with this coffee is its aftertaste.  It lingers forever, long after you've finished your last sip and it's not very pleasant.

3492,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B001AG6BMO,Kate McMurry,"Two big reasons that I choose this brand of coconut oil over the many other brands in the marketplace are that it is organic and it comes in a glass jar, so there is no leaching of chemicals from plastic into the oil. This brand also has a terrific flavor.Coconut oil is a good substitute for non-organic butter and margarine made from hydrogenated fat (which produces inflammation in the body).Coconut oil adds an exquisite taste to almost any food it is included in, but especially curries, baked goods and homemade ice cream.Coconut oil is excellent for the skin. It moisturizes, protects and heals the skin, and it functions as a mild sunscreen. Its natural smell is heavenly, and it makes a wonderful massage oil. It can be used to condition the hair. When used as a mouthwash, the fatty acid it contains, lauric acid, kills harmful microbes, thereby helping prevent cavities and gum disease.We have, fortunately, moved past the era when consumers were wrongly warned to avoid coconut oil in their diet because it is a saturated fat. As it turns out, liquid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and, worse, hydrogenated, solid PUFA, which consumers were advised to substitute for saturated fats, are truly awful for the health. Among other problems, they suppress thyroid and immune function and spread free radicals in the body. Coconut oil, on the other hand, has so many health benefits, it is now classified by many health experts as a ""superfood.""Research has indicated that coconut oil is helpful in treating and preventing Alzheimer's, and it helps prevent epileptic seizures. It is protective of the thyroid. It satiates hunger so you crave less food when you eat, and it raises the metabolism so that the body is more efficient in burning fat, especially the most dangerous kind, visceral, abdominal fat. It raises the levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood.In addition to the fatty acid, lauric acid, that coconut oil naturally contains, during digestion the body creates from coconut oil a monoglyceride called monolaurin. Both of these fatty acids have the ability to kill harmful bacteria, fungi and viruses in the body. This means that if you regularly consume coconut oil, you are less likely to become sick from food-borne illnesses, flu and colds. It also insulates you from the effects of Staphylococcus Aureus (a very dangerous pathogen) and Candida Albicans, which causes yeast infections throughout the body.Coconut oil is classified as a ""fruit oil,"" and they are considered the healthiest oils around. Other fruit oils include avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, grape seed oil, and olive oil. Technically nut oils are also fruit oils, because a nut can, by one definition, be seen as a ""one-seeded fruit."" However, the reverse is not true of a coconut. Though a coconut is a fruit, is not truly a nut. A true nut, for example an acorn, does not open up when it is mature in order to release its seeds. Instead, the seeds are released when the walls of the fruit decay or it is eaten and digested by an animal and released onto the ground in the midst of animal waste. In contrast, a coconut has three pores or ""eyes"" at one end. Within these pores the coconut seed germinates and a shoot emerges from the pores much in the way shoots emerge from the ""eye"" of a potato.",5,"Delicious, very pure coconut oil",1374364800

I am often disappointed in getting back to an unfinished portion and finding them stale. After being stuck with practically bendable crackers later, I started emptying the whole container into a ziplock back and hoping they remained crisp.Well, now they've introduced a new ""Fresh Stacks"" packaging, which cuts the number of crackers in each individual package in half. Just about the right amount of crackers for two to enjoy.The rest is easy, just get a glass of your favorite beverage and enjoy these iconic crackers, knowing that the next ""stack"" is going to be crisp and fresh! My serving suggestion is to layer vanilla ice cream between two of these bad boys and you have about the best ice cream sandwich possible.But exactly does the world ""graham"" mean? In 1829, a minister named Sylvester Graham invented a new way to process flour. Instead of grinding whole grain wheat kernels , graham flour's parts get ground up separately. The inside of the kernel gets ground at a fine setting, which makes standard white flour. Then the outside germ and bran are ground using a coarse setting. Once they are all mixed together, it creates a more textured product which bakes easier and tastes sweeter. It's also much better for you and has a higher fiber content.Well, as alternately boring and interesting as that all is, we owe it to Sylvester for today's resulting graham crackers, which are pretty much a staple food at my house. And Nabisco's Honey Maid is - after much testing of other manufacturers' competing product - easily the best graham cracker out there.

I prefer the EcoBrew because I don't have to dismantle my brewer to use it.  I was intrigued by the Melitta Javajig because it uses paper filters which makes it easier to brew more than one cup of coffee - or so I thought.  To use the Javajig, you place the paper filter over the brown ring and slide the green cone over it.  Flip it over and put in your coffee and attach the lid.  Now you have a K-cup.  The coffee that came out of it was weak (I use a larger cup setting) and I had grounds in my cup.  After brewing, I wanted to try another cup on a smaller setting so I pulled the Javajig out of the machine.  It is VERY hot.  In fact, it was so hot I couldn't open the lid so I could take it apart and put a new filter on it.  Then the whole thing fell apart, spilling wet coffee grounds everywhere.  Did I mention hot?  I am used to being able to hold a K-cup by the top edge but you really shouldn't do that with the javajig.Pluses - disposable paper filter makes cleanup easy and you can quickly make a second cup.Minuses - weak coffee (maybe I'll try a finer grind) and difficult to handle after brewing.

There are so many health benefits to CO it is a miracle that you don't have to have a prescription to buy it.Google 'coconut oil health benefits' and prepare to be floored by this amazing natural boon to mankind. No kidding. From just one sentence of one of those pages: Coconut oil is antiviral, antifungal (kills yeast too) and antibacterial.It is incredible both topically and orally. I use it as a pre-shave lotion. I put a few drops on my tooth-brush before putting the toothpaste on. I use it as a hand lotion.Most organic EV CO taste like coconut to some degree and usually strongly. Nutiva OEVCO certainly does have a coconut taste. So, cooking most foods in it is yukky. But there are many ways to get CO into your daily routine. Eating a T straight up is like a 5 hr energy shot. Put it in your coffee (takes some getting used to but I do 4T every morning like that). Make 'coconut oil bark' - google it. There are more tasteless versions you can use for cooking. I use the refined pure CO from LouAnn brand for cooking just about everything.CO encourages fat burning.A word of caution. When you first start supplementing with CO go slowly. Because of the anti-allBadThings nature of CO it will upset your stomach, because it kills off gut flora in droves, if you zap yourself with, say, a full tablespoon right off the bat. It'll make you feel nauseous and bathroom bound for one or more hours. Start with .5 or 1 teaspoon and spend a week working your way up to 1+ tablespoons.A word about Nutiva and Amazon. Excellent! If you do sub and save, this 2 pack is an amazing value delivered right to your door. I've bought the two pack 8 or 10 times and only once had any hint of oil in the box and the two jugs were still sealed.If you are new to the world of organic CO then you should buy a small amount first. Some people are actually allergic to it. And some people just don't like it. Don't buy a 55 gallon drum of it and then find out it is awful for you. You can get organic CO at any health food store (for an arm and a leg) and Wal-Mart carries it in their pharmacy area.

43829,A2KMY4RVMJ1EP6,B007NRQ516,faeriemyst,"First off, the gift basket was very well-packed, and surprisingly, most everything fared well in transit. At an initial glance the gift basket is gorgeous. With a beautiful bow and a nice basket holding the goodies along with the coordinating colors the foodstuff is packaged in, it's just a very elegant product. As opposed to having products from one single manufacturer, this gift basket is comprised of eleven separated companies, which I think is a great way to try out new items. While I won't be listing any specifics about calories or portion sizes, I did glance through the ingredients and there wasn't anything too bad for a basket full of sweets.Here's a list of products rated worst to best:Torani Chocolate Biscotti (1 biscotti) -  If you like chocolate and biscotti, you may like it, but I wasn't very impressed.Cashew Roca (3 individually wrapped) - Pretty decent. Has a nice crunch without feeling like your teeth will break off and the toffee had a good flavor to it.Biscoff European Cookies (6 individually wrapped) -  They're good, somewhat reminiscent of a shortbread cookie, but I can live without them.Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies - These did not ship well at all. About a third were broken because they're rather crumbly cookies (about 1"" diameter), but I liked them because they're kinda buttery. Can't really taste any chocolate chips though.Chocolate Cream Puffs - Tiny bite-sized cream-filled chocolate wafers that are nice and flaky. A nice treat.Peppermint Popcorn Crunch - This was definitely the oddball of the gift basket. I was a bit tentative when I first thought ""peppermint popcorn!"" until I saw it was toffee popcorn with flakes of peppermint. I ended up really liking this because the flavors really complement each other and it's a rather refreshing snack.Classic Chocolate Wafer Cookies (12 square cookies) - The name of these cookies is actually misleading, as they are a vanilla wafer with a fudgy filling. A good treat that is low in calories and isn't that sweet.Claey's Kettle Fresh Fudge (2 individually wrapped) - I am not a big fan of non-peanut butter fudge, but I loved this chocolate fudge! Nice and creamy, with a nice texture. Rich, without rotting out my teeth. Sign me up!Angelina's Sweet Butter Cookies (10 cookies in 5 different shapes) - I adore butter cookies and these are probably the best I've ever had. Totally addictive, but oh so worth it!Dolcetto Wafer Rolls (About 24 3-4"" rolls) - Described as ""Every bite will melt in your mouth,"" which is so true! Very, very yummy and better than any wafer rolls I've ever had before.Chocolate Truffle Cookies (2 individually wrapped cookies) - To. Die. For. So light and crunchy and delicious! For being dipped into chocolate, these aren't too rich. Utter perfection.All of the items had the perfect amount of sweetness added, which was great for me as while I have a sweet tooth, I don't like anything too sugary.Overall, I am very impressed with this gift set, from how it looks to what items were selected and how they taste, it's almost heavenly. Since I don't know what this will sell for, I can't say if it's a good deal or not yet, but I definitely think this would be a great gift for family and friends who enjoy high quality gourmet sweets.",5,(4.5 stars) Pure elegance in gorgeous packaging!,1339372800

The first cup I didn't boil and I didn't wait....yeap..I got a little flavor and I wonder...is that all?  So I followed the directions on the package...and well, the taste dramatically improved. You get spinach chive, carrot curry, beet cabbage, tomato mint, fennel spice and  broccoli cilantro.  My first impression was oh yuch ... cabbage tea...spinach tea?  Believe it or not, there isn't that strong pungent smell with the cabbage or spinach tea...noticeable yes, but not over powering....at least to me.it is at the right level... along with the other spices and seasoning in the tea to actually make it pleasant.

The broth has a nice beefy flavor, but I don't taste much ginger; instead, it tastes more like beef and mushrooms.  I usually add a bit of hot sauce to spice it up a bit.  Along with the noodles, there are pieces of dehydrated vegetables - mostly green onion - as well as beef pieces.  The beef pieces are ok but don't really add much to the bowl.

Through the plastic I could see lots of coffee grounds loose which I never had before in a shipment.  Sending the Kcups back was not an option as it is too expensive.  I began using them and found the seal on most of the K-cups had been broken allowing coffee grounds to spill out.  Several of the K-cups had large holes in them with no coffee left.  The coffee grounds were everywhere making a huge mess.  The coffee in the K-cups was stale tasting because of the broken seals and in general aweful tasting and left tons of coffee grounds in the cup after brewing.  I will not order this coffee again.  I do not understand what is happening to Amazon.com.  In the past I have had wonderful experiences ordering from them.  Products arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  As a disabled senior, this is important to me because I have no way to get out to shop other than a quick trip to a local store.  I really came to depend upon Amazon to give me the best product, price, and delivery.  However; the last few orders have come very late, totally unacceptable in their performance, and consequently I will not order Green Mountain Coffee again as I live on a very limited budget and cannot afford to throw out $30 worth of coffee.

For example, a 16oz jar of 365 brand organic almond butter (roasted, not raw) at my local Whole Foods costs $14.  Amazon is offering two 12oz Jars of Maisie Jane's for $15.45 - an easy decision.  However, in terms of quality and taste, I prefer raw organic almond butter, of which I find Once Again brand to be the best buy in terms of balancing quality and taste with price.  Unfortunately, raw almond butter is more expensive and the price on Amazon fluctuates.  For example, I used to be able to buy a 16oz jar of Once Again raw organic almond butter for $12.75, but the price is now $17.68.  Until the price comes down (if it ever does), I'm settling for Maisie Jane's.  So compared to raw organic almond butter, this product comes up short.

41892,A1PI8VBCXXSGC7,B00917VTQC,Lynn,"Until I was asked if I'd like to review San Fransisco Salt Company Chef Salt, I never knew that flavored salt existed. A look at their website left my head spinning as I read through their list of gourmet salts.  Their website also lists the benefits of sea salt.The traditional  salt of the Hawaiian Islands, red Alaea Hawaiian Salt, has been used  for centuries in Hawaiian sacred ceremonies to cleanse and purify tools and canoes & in healing rituals for medicinal purposes. It is harvested from  Pacific waters using solar evaporation. Solar evaporation  allows the salt crystals to form with  desired trace minerals intact. The red color comes from  Hawaiian volcanic clay, alae, which is infused in  this salt. The alae doesn't add any flavor but provides nutritional value by  adding  digestible dietary iron and is said to contain 80 different, naturally occurring, trace minerals.Its mellow flavor compliments all types of meat dishes, as well as pasta, seafood, soups, stews, stir-fry, grilled vegetables, eggs  and to my surprise  is gaining popularity as a topping for chocolate desserts and ice cream.I made delicious slow cooker pork with only three additional ingredients, liquid smoke, garlic and Alaea Hawaiian Salt.  I inserted several garlic cloves into the meat & rubbed almost 2 tablespoons of Alaea salt all over the 5 lb. roast, then added a couple tablespoons of liquid smoke which I let run over & around the pork being careful not to wash the salt off of the roast. I slow cooked this til the roast was tender (10+ hours). Then pulled the roast apart & mixed it with the pan juices which were tested for saltiness first.  Very good! I preferred the pork mixed with pan juices; my hubby preferred the pork with barbecue sauce.I used the 'Fine' grain salt which is the preferred choice for sprinkling on food/cooking.1/4 teaspoon = 16% of the daily sodiumKosher CertifiedSun-K KosherThe salt was shipped in a sealed, thick plastic, zippered bag. I was surprised to find a sample of French Grey Gourmet Chef Salt included in the shipment.

37083,A3AZI828WJN1CD,B009LHGT8K,"Becky in NOLA ""Becky""","If you are looking at the Singolo espresso machine you might have already decided the convenience of the capsule outweighs the price. I have done several internet searches and the average price of a capsule works out to about 124 dollars per pound, according to MSN money. However, I do not ding a star for that because none of the capsule machines claim to be money savers unless they are being compared to coffee shops. So money aside let's talk machine.I have a Nespresso and I love it. I really liked my Delonghi espresso machine, but the ease and convenience of a capsule machine seduced me over to the capsule side.Both the Nespresso machines and the Singolo work with 19 bars of pressure. The nespresso offers several machines at various price points, from the esenza I own to the more expensive machines that have milk tanks. As of now the Singolo is the only machine I have found in the line and comes in white or black.The Singolo is programmed for large and small cups. Various Nespresso machines come programmed, mine is manual.Both machines work in basically the same manner, open lever, put in the capsule, close the lever, push the button. Some nespresso machines can take larger cups so the milk can be added first, mine is not adjustable. Taking the catch tray off the bottom of the Singolo allows a larger coffee cup to be used. Nespresso also makes adjustable tray machines.Nespresso used to be made in Switzerland but now appears to be made in China according to what I can find on with internet research.The Singolo states several times it is designed in Italy, however, according to the box it is made in china.The Nespresso has a wide variety of capsules, the Singolo has four, one is decaf.The Nespresso takes 1 minute 12 seconds to get ready (mine is the least expensive machines, I have seen reviews where higher end machines like the pixie take less time) The Singolo took 1 minute 10 seconds.The Singolo came out at around 170 degrees, the Nespresso at 165.The nespresso took 22 seconds to pull a cup of espresso. The Singolo took 1 minute for one pull, 38 seconds the next.The automatic turn off is not really something I care about as I can stand there for a whole 40 seconds to a minute.The Singolo is large, weighing in at 15 pounds. The top lever barely fits under our cabinet and there isn't enough clearance to get our hand up to pull it down.The Singolo is a counter eater:Front to back measures 15 inches. Width is 6 3/4 inches. From top to bottom with the lever up is 15 inches, closed is 12 inches.There are four capsules at this time:Decaf which is described as Dense and intense,Toscano - strong character that stands up beautifully in milk,Vigore- dense, intense, and very creamy,Verita-a mellow roast with fruit finish.I tried all four varieties. I drink my espresso black, Jim drinks his with sugar. I must say the espresso I was drawing simply wasn't good. Jim said they tasted like cheap beans and I thought everything had a plastic taste. We emptied the tank and put fresh water in to try again, at which point Jim discovered the valve on the bottom of the tank doesn't seal and it drips if there is water in it, but you can fill the tank without taking it off the machine. We tried again. Each time the various shots just didn't taste good. The espresso tasted either sour or bitter and over extracted. With more established machines you have a much larger choice of coffee.I don't know what the price point on amazon is going to be. The machine is for sell already on the net and you can see what they have it listed for.Because of the lack of variety in the cups, the counter space and cabinet clearance issues, the unknowns as in will there be more varieties eventually? And finally the taste of the espresso offered at this time, I cannot recommend the Singolo machine. There are better more established capsule machines already on the market with really good espresso.My machine came with the capsules out of the box, they were still in their foil sealed, but they were put around the machine while the boxes were flat and laying on top. I wasn't sure if I was sent a box each of all four capsules because I'm vine or if a regular buyer would get them like that. I called customer service and had to leave a message. A very nice woman called back within the hour, but she didn't know and said she'd have to check. 5 hours later and I still don't know.

One just plain, like a trail mix sort of snack and another with milk. I definitely preferred the plain over a bowl of milk. I feel like the milk gave it a strange texture/flavor. So that being said, it's really a matter of preference.I feel like this would work well as a yogurt topper or something like that. As I said, just plain works well. What I love about this mix is that it does taste great. I'm not a huge cinnamon lover but I do love this. I don't feel it's overpowering at all.I have diabetes and I've learned that cinnamon can help regulate blood sugar so for me it's a great way to start the morning or for a quick mid-afternoon snack.Unlike most cereals this product has extra protein and fiber to help you feel more full during the day for a longer period of time. That's something that also works well for me because I'm not a huge breakfast person.

There's no mention of chorizo anywhere on this package, of course - it's not healthy, it'd scare people off - and the ingredients claim no pork heritage at all.The spice mix that is listed includes chili pepper, parsley, cumin, jalapeno, and of course as you'd expect from cheezits a variety of cheeses: white cheddar, regular cheddar, and blue cheese.

Specifically ""Spitz"" sunflower seeds.Compared to David brand.- David brand seeds are so salty they make the tongue and mouth go numb.- The seeds inside the shell are tiny and underdeveloped.- They're more expensive than the Spitz seeds I'm eating now.I'm not one for brand loyalty but I can see how some people are. For me, these seeds are not as good in quality as the Spitz seeds I've purchased.

The first 2 ingredients are corn syrup and sugar and the fruit is actually apple puree. Though they show orange, strawberry, grape and raspberry shapes on the box, the flavoring is provided by apple, elderberry and chokeberry juices.But when you buy fruit chews, you pretty much know what you're getting anyway: a lunch box treat for the kids.  There's always a trade off with these snacks. While these actually have fruit puree in them, there's less vitamin C. The Market Pantry (Target) snacks have 100% daily Vitamin C and no fruit. The Welch's brand has fruit puree and 100% Vitamin C.Since this is a treat--and not really a source of nutrition--you have to go on taste and appearance.  My 8 and 6 year olds liked these, but didn't think they were any better than any others. They'd rather have a familiar shape, like the ones Kellogg's offers in cartoon shapes.If you're looking for nutrition, go elsewhere.  After all this is a processed food.  If you're looking for a simple fruit chew, these are it and they taste pretty good.  However, it's best to label shop if you're trying to watch ingredients.",3,More sugar than fruit,1375401600

The pasta is easy to make, just brown the ground beef, dump everything into a pot, boil, cover, and simmer undisturbed while you go do something more useful than standing at the stove.The stroganoff is thick, creamy, and yet relatively `light' tasting - 1 cup of prepared stroganoff is approximately 0.5 grams of fat, according to the nutrition facts on the box. I always cut back on the meat - it calls for a pound of meat, but half or even a third of a pound is plenty for me. I use organic whole milk and unsalted butter and the result is a creamy deliciousness that I don't feel too terribly guilty about. I think the result would even be good without meat - for the vegetarians out there - if you wanted to experiment.I'm really pleased to be able to order this on Amazon - the bulk ordering is cheaper and I don't have to lug it home from the store, which saves gasoline money.

You can taste the seaweed, but the predominate taste is salt.Each pack has a little plastic bin holding the paper thin slices of seaweed plus a silica moisture-absorbing packet. Each pack weighs only 0.17 oz - so the silica packet and plastic bin are most of the weight.In other words, there is not much to this snack. It's packaged very well, so that the thin slices are intact and dry. I like the taste, and the seaweed does have vitamins, especially vitamin C. But there is little volume to the snack in one packet and yet one packet has 50 mg of sodium.Granted, it's low salt in terms of mg. But it's not low salt in terms of percentage of volume. This isn't a snack to stave off hunger - there just isn't enough of it. But it is a snack that is tasty.",4,"Tastes great, but not what I'd call low-salt",1322956800

Those of you with celiac out there know all about the problems we have with finding good pizza. G-free pizza crusts are starting to show up in greater frequency at restaurant that serve pizza, however it appears that most of these restaurants are getting their crust from the same vendor and the crust that is available is too sweet and has a biscuit-like texture. This tapioca-based pizza is much better than those crusts. It is not sweet, it has a good savory taste that you expect from a pizza crust. The tapioca also tends to stick together better than rice flours so the pizza has the crispy and chewy texture that you want from pizza (and the property that makes gluten such an important part of most breads and crusts).While I think this is a great product I do have a couple of caveats:-Be very careful with your ratios, if you add even a little bit too much water to the crust you can end up with a gooey, rather than a crispy crust which not really enjoyable (trust me, I've been there).-This product is basically just tapioca flour with spices, so you could just get some tapioca flour for cheaper. That being said, the spices are good and it is convenient to have the amount of flour your need already weighed out (especially since the flour to water ratio is so important).

From the description and even the packaging it is sometimes easy to confuse with some kind of coffee.

They offer several recipes for ways to use the product which I did not try.  Unlike most teas, you use coffee preparation techniques to make Redespresso.Per the directions, I did prepare the tea in a french press.  It was a dark red color, and because the tea is finer than coffee, loose tea does get into the liquid.  The flavor was pleasant, but not overly distinctive for a tea.Overall, it was not as tasty as some of my other favorite teas.

I sampled about 10 expiration dates and they were all in the future, from 2-5 months away.

It's not flavored salt: it's just salt, with some natural minerals owing to its origins, that give it a slightly pinkish flavor. Still, it's salt with a difference. I'm not sure how to describe it - it's salty, but with a little something extra, or maybe a little something taken away. I'd almost want to say with a touch of sweet, but that's not quite right. It is strong as salt, but it has a subtler, maybe slightly less bitter or biting flavor to it. It tastes more smooth than ordinary salt, but isn't any less salty for that, if that makes any kind of sense.It's got a nice graininess to it too. I like it added to soup, where it dissolves completely and adds a nice flavor; I also like it on my scrambled eggs, and I add it just after they're cooked so that a bit of the graininess remains and it doesn't entirely dissolve into liquid. I've had it on baked sweet potatoes - on just about everything that I add salt to - and I like this better than the usual salt.Until trying this, I usually ended up buying Kosher salt, and I could tell the difference between that and the standard iodized table salt. Occasionally I've bought sea salt, and I like that too. I think I like this himalayan salt best, though. It's a subtle difference, but a difference I can taste and a difference that I like.",5,"Smoother than ordinary salt, without being any less salty - I really like the subtle difference that this makes on my plate",1381622400

I reviewed a Vine sample of Gringo Bandito a while ago, and gave it high marks. Now along comes the Gringo Bandito Variety Pack. Bring it on!The word ""Variety"" in this case means ""Two."" The pack contains two bottles each of red and green hot sauces. They're not otherwise distinguished by clever names or by any other means. Both bottles simply say ""Hot Sauce."" The red one has a shaker top while the green just pours. Go figure.They have relatively short ingredient lists, which is a definite plus. Other than ""mojo"" and ""Xanthan gum,"" the ingredients are natural--vinegar, water, Haba&ntilde;ero peppers, Jalape&ntilde;o peppers, Serrano peppers, red Japanese chili peppers, more peppers...How do they taste? Well, taste is highly subjective. If I say, ""They taste great,"" it doesn't mean much. What tastes great to me may be unpalatable to someone else. Right up front, both of these hot sauces have the characteristic, distinctive, unmistakable Haba&ntilde;ero taste. And they ARE very hot. They'll sneak up on you, so start with just a little and work your way up. I taste-tested them by putting a few dollops on two leftover restaurant fish filets, one prepared Vallarta-style with onions, cheese and green chiles, and the other Tampique&ntilde;a-style with tomatoes and green chiles. The hot sauces added excellent flavor and spiciness to the already-spicy filets. Mmmmm!In side-by-side taste tests with Haba&ntilde;ero Tabasco, the Gringo Banditos were a little less hot and had simpler flavor profiles. In the comparison, they seemed a little ""bland"" (if that can ever be said of a Haba&ntilde;ero pepper sauce).But that's not a complaint. These hot sauces offer a great spectrum of heat and flavor.

I'm a sucker for apple flavoring in just about anything, so this was a real winner.  The taste of the drink is quite good, the mix of water and juice just right.  The taste on drinking is very good, subtly apple, but not overpowering; thankfully, this is not a liquidJolly Rancher Appledrink.  The aftertaste is quite good, too, quiet and definitely apple-y.  I anticipated a slight metallic taste, which one sometimes finds with apple flavorings, but encountered none of that with this product, a definite plus.My biggest complaint: the small serving size.  At only 8.4 oz., there just isn't enough there to satisfy me, especially if actually thirsty.  Now, I understand why this is packaged this way.  As it stands, this small little package is pushing 90 calories.  At a regular 12 oz. size, it would be about 128 calories, which would be an awfully tough thing to market.  So, you've got to get your satisfaction in the space of eight and a half ounces, or open up another one and go for 17.The can's text has me wondering.  I'm told that it's made from pure fruit juice, but that there are other natural flavors and it's a naturally flavored juice beverage, from concentrate.  Huh?  Now, that's an awful lot of dissembling and non-clear information.  Is it pure or not?  Is it just juice and sparkling water or not?  Given all of the caveats on the packaging, I tend to think it's not nearly as clear as they'd like us to believe it is.

After soaking and steaming the vermicelli still did a decent job holding it's shape.Texture : My kids did not really like the texture of the vermicelli and prefer the Tinkyada pasta and noodles. I actually think the texture mimics Mai Fun very well and if you enjoy a Mai Fun stir fry this would be excellent. The rice/sago texture really does not make it a good substiture for pasta.Flavor: Nice clean rice based flavor. It picked up the flavor of the cooking liquid very nicely.Recipes on the package : The instructions on these are pretty vague. There is no ingredient list or amounts in the recipes. The instructions tell you, as an example, to ""prepare a clear soup stock with anchovies, soybeans, salt and sugar; mix a variety of vegetables strips in oyster and soya sauce with the stock, add blanched brown rice vermicelli, toss and simmer until cooked."" If you can soar with a recipe like this, go for it. If not, I'd look online for stir fry recipes using Mai Fun. Note also that the recipe stated that you should use 'blanched' noodles, while the preparation instructions for the noodles state that you soak them in room temperature water! I found that the soaking at room temperature worked fine but you do need more than a minute for the noodles to soften. I think that the recipe is a little 'lost in translation' but the product is still a good one if you can find a better recipe for it.Is it REALLY Gluten Free? : If you're living with Celiac disease your criteria for what makes something 'gluten free' is often a very strict one. I've learned to trust many of the items that are made in the US and labeled Gluten free as long as the allergy information does not say that it is made on equipment shared with wheat products. The packaging on this item does not say anything regarding shared equipment and the same Singapore based brand also produces wheat flour and wheat starch. Except for the Gluten free label up front and the ingredient list (Brown Rice, Sago Starch and water) there is no further explanation of it's gluten free status. My child with celiac is not super reactive to trace amounts of gluten but, if you are, this may be something to consider.I did call the East Coast distributors but was unable to get an answer for the shared equipment question. I will email the manufacturers and update this review if I get an answer. Unless I can determine for sure that the factory uses dedicated gluten free equipment we will, unfortunately, not be using this product again.",4,"Vermicelli, Celiac Disease and recipes, oh my!",1327449600

Definitely it's a drink for those, like me, who love spicy foods.  It's a great waker-upper, but you probably won't want to drink it every day.To make the drink, you combine one pouch (0.56 oz.) of Gold Kili Instant Ginger & Lemon Mix with 1-1/4 cup (250 ml) of hot water, and stir.  A sniff of the powdered mix offers a good preview of the drink itself.  The powder dissolves quickly in water heated to about 185 degrees Fahrenheit (well below boiling).  The resulting drink is the color of coffee with cream.  An ""instant powder foam"" forms on top with stirring, but the foam disappears quickly.The drink itself is sweet, but leaves little sugary aftertaste.

So, I attempted my first cup of this Lipton K-Cup Iced Tea Lemonade using a 12 oz glass, filled to the max with ice cubes, and dispensing 6 oz of beverage from my Keurig.  Results? . . . .Perfect combination.  Filled my glass almost to the top, and when the hot beverage melted down some of the ice, I was left with a nice cold glass of the tea/lemonade, still about 1/3 full of ice.  Just right.  The taste? . . . .Something like a very, very heavily lemon-ed iced tea.  Not quite a lemonade, as there is still a tea flavor (good tea) lurking in the background.  Pleasantly sweet but not excessively.  And for me, when I'm really hot and thirsty, lemonade is good but does not quench thirst like very lightly sweetened iced tea.  I think this beverage will give that iced tea thirst-quenching benefit.A note from the nutrition labeling:  45 cal per serving (not bad for a real sugar beverage), no nutritional benefits other than 4% RDA carbs.  Contains real tea,  sugar, citric acid, and a few lesser ingredients for flavor (generally natural, nothing objectionable).In short, I think the Lipton folks really did their homework on this one.  I would have expected it from them as the &#34;tea leaders&#34;, but so often there is disappointment with a new product.  Not here.

The first was cheap and made great-tasting lattes, much better than Charbucks -- but it only lasted three years. The second was more expensive and, sadly, we never got it to produce anything as good as the first machine. To make matters worse, I had grown tired of cleaning up the mess after each use. I was hopeful when Starbucks introduced VIA, but no matter what strength/flavor I used, it was so harsh (acidic?) that it messed up my stomach. It cost a fortune to boot.Luckily, good fortune was just around the corner. About a year ago, while visiting some relatives, we were introduced to these little gems. Now I just put 8 oz. milk in the microwave for 2:30, stir in one of these, add a little sugar, and voila -- a latte that's almost as good as what our old espresso machine made, with no mess to clean up. If you use lactose-free milk, you can use even less sugar since the lactose has already been broken down into sugar that you can taste. This product is already much cheaper than regular Starbucks or VIA, but if you can find the large plastic containers of crystals rather than these individual packets, your cost per serving will drop even more.Bottom line: if you are looking for an inexpensive way to have tasty coffee drinks at home without the mess of an espresso machine, this might just fit the bill.",5,Coffee snob takes the low road... and is amazed,1282089600

I recall thinking, ""hum -- this ought to be an okay way to start the day"".I do feel rather silly now as this is neither health food or a breakfast in a bag. What it is, as I found out, is rather difficult not to finish once opened. Like others before me, I was rather grateful that the bag I opened was only a 4.5 ounce promo from Amazon or I would have eaten a 12 ounce bag just as quick.JUST WHAT IS THIS STUFF?Obviously, this new product from General Mills is well designed to excite many human palates into consuming mass quantites of the stuff. I do believe that 'Wheat Middlings' has the same effect on pigs and molasses has that effect on goats. Well, after wolfing down a 4.5 ounce bag of this stuff in 5 minutes I must admit to feeling a little like both a pig and a goat. My only regret is that Amazon did not include some Alka-Seltzer or a more modern substitute in the box with the 'Chocolate Chex Snack Mix, Turtle', as I could use some right about now.BOTTOM LINE: BETTER FOR YOU THAN POTATO CHIPS -- BUT NOT MUCHMost of all, this stuff is very palatable, and lends itself to whole bag consumption in single sittings. Sounds a lot like Potato Chips, recall the ""I bet you can't eat just one"" ads a generation ago and one can see this product as the 21st century equivalent. Chex Snack Mix may be more sophisticated and more colorfully packaged and promoted than Potato Chips, but it basically is designed to entice the 'Potato Chip', 'Chocolate Candy', 'Salty Pretzel' crowd into filling their shopping carts and ergo their tummys' with 'Chex Mix'.My big regret here is that while General Mills got the palatability issue down cold here, they fudged quite a bit on the healthiness of the ingredients. Looking at the nutrition info one is struck by the long list of artificial colorings, preservatives [like BHT] and artificial flavors without the usual balance found in breakfast cereals in the form of added vitamins, minerals and more. The fat content, usually negligible in even the most sugary of cereals, is a whopping 30%. It is only that low because of the absence of any fat in sugar, which makes up about 1/3 of the calories [of Chex Snack Mix] of each serving.The key in the consumption of this product has to be moderation, but alas, the product is designed to override moderation by sending our appetites into overdrive. As for myself, I will be careful to keep these little treats out of my sight, though it may be a perfect alternative to Potato Chips for those who can't eat just one of those little treats.[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY COMPANY OR PRODUCT]",4,SILLY ME: I WAS EXPECTING CHEX CEREAL IN A BAG,1157328000

Great taste and plenty strong.... however lately since I got the subscriptions service, the coffee grounds end up in my cup!  This appears to be only in their bulk purchases of 50 k-kups as I don't have this problem with the retail packaged purchases.  This is the ONLY brand I've had this trouble with.  Problem is with about 60% of the K-cups in this batch.  Untill the last batch I recieved I didn't have this problem.  Less than 5 minutes ago I brewed a cup of this and found the entire top of my coffee had coffee grounds floating on it.  I thought that the bottom needle inside the brewing basket was clogged at first... but DONUT SHOP regular coffee is the only one I've had a problem with... Their Decaf is fine!!  I decided to investigate!  Yipper! I found the problem... a manufacturing defect where the filter inside the k-cup was not entirely attached to the top sides of the k-cup  and the coffee grounds coming up through the TOP of the K-cup!!, thus allowing coffee grounds to spill out through the inside of the basket and out the little exit hole in the bottom of the k-cup.  I'm suspending my subscription to this coffee until they get the manufacturing defect fixed.  Wait for a month or so to see if they bother to secure the filter inside the k-cup a little better!UPDATE!: February 25th, 2010The REAL problem is that the cup is pressurized with nitrogen... too much pressure!  So for those of you (that includes ME!) That are willing to do an extra step when brewing this coffee, place the K-cup in the basket... press down on the TOP of the K-cup WITH ONE THUMB ON EACH SIDE OF THE CUP... (do NOT press the cup in the center) to force the bottom needle through the bottom of the K-cup... THEN close the compartment with the handle!  It works!

It's basically cans of the three basic ingredients you need (diced tomatoes, kidney beans, and tomato sauce) as well as a spice packet.  The actual chili is decent, but they must keep the flavor pretty tame (read: only marginally spiced) to appeal to a broad audience.  So, as I said, do you know how to make chili?I DO!* Then just take an old spice jar, mix up your normal 'chili spices' and stock up on a few cans of ingredients.  Boom -- Hunt's Chili Kit at probably 1/2 the cost.  And since they're your own spices, you have plenty 'on hand' to adjust as you'd like and give it a bit more panache.I'D LIKE TO // O RLY?  THAT'S IT?* I understand many people just don't know a good 'chili spice mix.'  Do some Googling to find the ""America's Test Kitchen"" chili recipe, mix a big batch of the spices up, and put it in a jar in your cabinet.  I love that chili recipe and you can't go wrong.  There genuinely is nothing about this kit that makes it 'special' or something you can't pull off for less.  I'm not kidding, it's three cans with labels in a box as well as a small spice packet.NO -- I HAVE NO IDEA // I DO, BUT NOT VERY WELL* Then this kit is for you!  The mix is pretty decent, no doubt, so if you don't want to bother pre-fabbing spices or aren't sure how and what seasoning to use, then this will definitely do.  Since the ingredients are 'legitimate' -- not just a can of industrial chili mix -- you come out with a better-tasting chili than the normal canned stuff you pick up in the chili aisle.In the end, I wouldn't buy this again.  You really are just paying for them to mix up a spice packet for you.  The cans are the same ones you find at the shelf at the grocery store for $1ish.  Find the ATK recipe, make your own, and save a few bucks along the way.Remember, use the recipe for simply mixing up the correct spice mixture.  Brown the meat, then add the tomato sauce, kidney beans, and diced tomatoes.  Simmer for 20 mins until it starts to thicken and get a bit darker.

They are made instead with corn starch and potato starch. At 140 (50 from fat) calories for 23 pretzels, they're a fairly satisfying snack overall. I found them quite filling and could not eat even 23 of them at one sitting (the bag says it holds 8 servings of 23 pretzels so this bag will last me a while!).

Each serving contains 420mg of sodium (18% of the RDA), which comes across well as these are salty but not overly so.

1177,A2DPYMNI2HCIOI,B005A1LINC,Seek Felicity,"My husband and I drink a good amount of Crystal Light powdered beverages.  I don't consider many of the Crystal Light selections to have an adult quality to them.  However, there is something about the Mojito flavor that is mature.First, it lacks the shockingly vibrant colors of many of the company's other selections.  If you picture the coloring of bright red lipstick or an orange pumpkin, you can get an idea of how many flavors of Crystal Light look in a glass.  The Mojito mix looks like cloudy water, if it is unadorned with mint leaves or other additions.I also find that compared to other Crystal Light beverages, the Mojito has a more complex flavor. It tastes like a diet limeaide and while I can see how the scientists that crafted this beverage would consider it to be a mojito-inspired creation, I don't know if I would have thought ""mojito"" without a packaging hint.  Still, it is a good beverage with layers of citrus and a bit of mint; a glass can be made even better by adding fresh mint leaves.If you are a pregnant gal, the designated driver, or a dieter, I think you could dress this beverage up to make it quite satisfactory for party purposes.  Crystal Light has successfully created a mature Crystal Light beverage option, which Crystal Light has relatively few of (the company'sCrystal Light Peach Tea Drink Mix (12-Quart), 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)andCrystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit Drink Mix (10-Quart), 3.4-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)are two other ""adult"" flavors).One negative with all of the Crystal Light products relates to packaging.  First, the container is a #5 plastic.  Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle.  I know Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don't live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with.  Additionally, if you like Crystal Light, it can be very easy to go through these containers quickly.  Some Crystal Light flavors have six packets and others, like the Mojito flavor, have five.

This morning, rather than my Harney and Sons loose leaf green, I used the Numi Organic Magnolia Puerh.  I realize that loose leaf is stronger and slightly tastier than bagged tea, but I am a Numi fan and was looking forward to their usually outstanding flavor.  This tea, however is pretty bland.  I had to add a speck of natural sugar to get a flavor from it.  Now, I haven't ever had Magnolia Puerh before, and this may be the type of flavor that comes from this type of tea, but I can't say I enjoyed a great cup of tea this morning.  The first thing I noticed was there wasn't any aroma.  No, ahhh moment when smelling the tea.  Then, upon first taste I didn't notice a flavor.  I decided to add a bit of sugar, but even then, not much.  A very faint smell of the Magnolia, but the flavor still pretty uneventful.

I follow several food blogs and foodgawker is a daily addiction, which is how I first heard about s Biscoff Spread.  In one day, on several different recipe sites, I kept seeing Biscoff mentioned.  The first was for a cookie ball made using biscoff, since the recipe poster said you could substitute butter for the Biscoff, I mistakenly assumed that Biscoff was a butter alternative that I hadn't heard of before.  But later I saw it mentioned again and then again on different sites and with increasingly rapturous praises for this 'amazing delicacy' and I just had to find out what it was.I'm just that way, if all the cool kids are eating Biscoff, I need to know what Biscoff is before I dismiss it as a trendy waste of time.As it turns out Biscoff is not new.  At least in Europe it isn't and after just one tiny taste of the heavenly stuff, I think I can safely predict that it will soon be a regular product on store shelves in North America.Like others before me have mentioned Biscoff is sweet and has a texture somewhere between Nutella (sticky, hard to spread if it isn't at a room temp and whipped cream cheese, airy and light, easy to plop onto a cool bagel (the weather has been super cold here and still the Biscoff was spreadable with a spoon right after delivery).The texture is smooth with a slight powdery-ness and it tastes sweet. just like a cookie.  In fact, it tastes like cookies, which is so strange that at first I wasn't sure if I liked it, so I took another bite and it was blissful, sweet but not too sweet, just the way I like my cookies, nom nom.  Biscoff is a melt-y, buttery, cookie delight, I like it even more than Nutella and I have an urge to hide the jars, so that I wont have have to share them with my husband and son!While Biscoff is tasty alone, it felt like I should try it out on something, I put a smidge on a thin ginger crisp, yum, tried some on a slice of apple and then a smear on a piece of toast (my bread was stale and kinda yecky, so it wasn't that great).

It's really, really bland.There's nothing inherently wrong with ""bland"" if that's what you are after.  Bland obviously is want one wants for a base for other things, for example.  But the marketing on this product seems deceptive to me.  It is sold as a ""meal in a bowl"" (suggesting it's not just a base, but a fully seasoned dish).  I specifically ordered it because I was looking for a quick way to make some basic cheesy pasta, and the product (and reviews) suggest that this is meant to be a cheese flavored item.  If it was marketed as ""pasta in a mild, light sauce with a hint of cheese flavor"", then I wouldn't have ordered it, because that wasn't what I was looking for.

OF FRESH PEANUTS OR CASHEWSThese 2 oz. packages are filled with fresh nuts with nothing but salt added [& peanut oil or cottonseed oil]. As snack foods go, this is a very healthy choice. Although expensive on an ounce for ounce basis, as portions of snack foods go, this is still a fair value and a relatively healthy choice. Bear in mind that about 75% of the 170 calories per ounce are from fat, but there are NO TRANS-FATTY ACIDS or CHOLESTEROL while there are some healthy mono-saturated oils.My big complaint against many other snack-nut products is their lack of freshness, and in fact a rancid taste to the nuts which NEVER happened with these Planters nuts. In fact, each individual package has an expiration date clearly marked on the front of the package.BOTTOM LINE: I PREFER THE LARGER JAR BECAUSE I EAT MORE THAN 2 OZ. AT A TIMEMy preference is to get these peanuts and cashews in the larger jar and unsalted, but for the summer, the salt is okay and the freshness was consistent in every package.For product info, Kraft has a website [plantersdotcom][I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]",4,VERY FRESH PEANUTS THOUGH AN EXPENSIVE WAY TO BUY THEM,1157155200

However oats and shape are about all that they have in common.  The taste of the Kashi cereal is quite different, and one might even say that it is an acquired taste.  I'll admit it is not a flavor that I try to seek out in any other foods, but it is one that I find pleasing enough after having eaten it for years.  I will say that it tastes a lot better than regular Cheerios which taste like Styrofoam.  In addition to taste, Heart to Heart wins over Cheerios on ingredients too.  While Cheerios list ""modified corn starch"" as an ingredient, Kashi using nothing modified.  Kashi also uses evaporated can juice which I prefer over sugar.  Heart to Heart also has a couple of additional ingredients that claim to promote heart health:  grape seed extract and green and white tea extracts.  The USDA has not substantiated these claims yet so take that for what it's worth.

I am a fan of creamed soups and the bag had a very easy recipe for turning the veggie soup into a creamed soup. I simmered some of the soup mix with water for about thirty minutes and then added some sauteed celery, carrots, onions, zucchini and a squash.  I cooked the soup for a bit longer and then blended away with a bit of So Delicious coconut milk.  The result was fantastic.  With a piece of french bread for dipping, I was in soup heaven.This Bob's Red Mill mix serves as an excellent base for soups.  My creamed soup had a distinct celery flavor, but depending on the vegetables you have lying around, you could easily make the soup taste more like peas or carrots.  For a fall soup with a bit of sweet edge, I think I will incorporate some apples.The contents of the soup mix include lentils and peas and alphabet pasta pieces.  It's nothing you couldn't put together on your own but Bob's Red Mill has done the work for you and for the price of each bag, I don't know how much you would save by assembling your own soup.  Each bag yields impressive quantities, especially when vegetables are added.  My 1 and 1/4 cups of soup mix with some vegetables yielded over four cups.

It's silly to really care about if something is a 'side' or a 'main' or whatever.What this really is, is pretty much your standard boxed macaroni and cheese, only with tiny ring shaped pasta. While the small size means it'll cook faster, I can't really say anything else about it is worthwhile. The smallness works against it too -- it means it's harder to deal with in the collander when draining, and harder to clean out of the pot when doing said draining.As for taste, it's just....bland. Kraft is better. Aunt Annie's is much better. And it doesn't help that suggested butter amount is 1tbsp more than normal for the same six oz.There's not much else one can say about it.

I adore my Keurig - its convenience, the freshness of the cup, and, yeah, convenience are extremely important to me, but I hate how dang WASTEFUL and EXPENSIVE the K-cups are, and all the plastic most companies use when crafting them makes me a bit leery.Enter San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Breakfast Blend.  Their ""coffee tea-bags"" ARE a bit stronger in both flavor and body than I had anticipated (vaguely reminiscent of that ""burnt Starbucks"" aftertaste that I can't stand) but this is easily forgivable as I tend to prefer a ""light"" roast, and is very easily tolerable - I simply use a bit more milk and sweetener in my cup.  There IS a wee bit of dark settlement sometimes left in the bottom of your cup, but hey, all you have to do to avoid that is just don't swirl your cup and you'll be fine.I love that the packaging is not only minimal (read: less annoying to deal with), but much less harmful for the environment AND my body (since certain kinds of plastics tend to leach estrogen compounds:  ""Most plastic products, from sippy cups to food wraps, can release chemicals that act like the sex hormone estrogen, according to a in Environmental Health Perspective"" from the article ""Study: Most Plastics Leach Hormone-Like Chemicals"" found on the NPR website if you care to look.)So, although I'd prefer a slightly more ""delicate"" (less ""burnt Starbuck-y"") flavor, I have to say:  great taste + less waste + less plastic + lower price = HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.I will definitely be buying more from this company...*especially if they could mimic the strong-but-clean flavors of Gevalia's Light Roast and, well, the strong-but-clean flavors of their Stockholm and Royal Vinter (yes: Vinter, and I brew it a bit on the weaker side b/c that really IS a strong-medium blend/roast) roasts, too...and maybe Folgers Gourmet Selections Classic Roast...yeah...I love my coffee...*Part of all that MAY have been an understated hint to the San Francisco Bay Coffee company...",5,"Good flavor and an EXCELLENT alternative to ""traditional"" K-cups",1393977600

One person really like it. Thought it was refreshing, flavorful, and an all around good drink. The opposite end someone thought it was very sour and they didn't like it at all. Me personally, I thought it was okay. For an apple flavor it seemed to taste a lot like a lemon-lime drink versus apple.Blackberry:By and large all of us didn't care nearly as much for this flavor. In fact the person who really liked the Apple flavor thought the Blackberry tasted like a cheap spimonti (sp) wine. I thought this flavor was a little on the tart side and if I am drinking something to be refreshed, tart is not the flavor I would want.I was disappointed in both flavors not tasting like what I expected. For 70% fruit juice I was expecting something that stayed more true to the fruit that was one the front of the can not a mixture of an asortment of different juices.The small cans are perfect for putting in a backpack, cooler etc. and at 90 calories they are relatively healthy as well.All in all, it's not a bad product and I can easily see where others may really like the flavors.

The trail mix was delicious.  (So was Sandra Bullock.)  I tried eating only half a bag, but couldn't.  The trail mix is composed mostly of peanuts, raisins, sun flower seeds and M&M-type; chocolate ""buttons.""  There are a few almonds and cashews thrown in for variety.  Almonds and cashews are expensive and I didn't expect to see many of them.When the movie ended, I realized I had ate the entire bag of David Seeds Trail Mix.  I then looked at the Nutrition Facts to learn what damage I had done to my body.  There are 4 servings per bag; each serving has 160 calories, 80 of which are fat.  Therefore, I consumed in one sitting 320 fat calories.  On a bright side, each serving has 2 grams of fiber (8 grams total); someone like me, who suffers from the constipation form of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), could benefit.  However, there are also 11 grams of sugar; therefore, diabetics may want to stay away from this product.This five ounce bag of trail mix is more suitable for sharing with another friend.  It is not healthy, in my opinion, to eat it all alone.  I suggest that David Seeds make smaller two ounce bags that are more appropriate for individual snacking.  However, one can always empty the five ounce bag of trail mix into Ziploc sandwich bags.  Another option is for David Seeds to make family size bags which can be easily divided into small containers.

If you like your chocolate milk rich with a nice chocolate color, here's a tip: stir a half teaspoon of unsweetened cocoa with a few drops of SweetLeaf Chocolate into 12 oz of cold milk. The cocoa won't mix with the milk very well, but if you put the milk in the fridge for 20 minutes, the cocoa will become saturated and will then stir into the milk with a spoon just like the syrup!

But I was curious what this box product would taste like.The first thing I noticed was that the uncooked ring pasta looked funny -- it didn't have the sharp edges I am used to.  It looked like it might be par boiled and then dried to cut down on the cooking time.  (And ring pasta doesn't take long to cook to begin with.) As I was draining the cooked pasta, I noticed that some of the rings were an off-color brown.  I also thought the texture of the cooked rings was different -- and not in a good way -- from what I am used to with ring pasta.Adding the butter, milk and cheese powder turned the pasta a much brighter shade of yellow-orange than is pictured on the box.

8808,A3VYKXHQDICC6,B000YVOHBI,philo_vance,"I sometimes find myself wanting a cup of coffee in the evening, after dinner. Two things prevent me from satisfying this crave. First, my usual caffeinated coffee will disturb my sleep if I consume it late in the day. And second, I don't want to brew a pot of coffee, even a 4-cup pot, for just one cup. That's where the Nescafe TC Decaf comes in.The coffee is packaged in single-serving plasticized paper tubes. You rip open the top (where it says ""Tear Here"" - they're not hard to open), pour into a cup, cover with 6 ounces of water, add milk and sugar and you're done. The individual packaging, though probably more costly than buying in a jar, adds value because the coffee remains sealed and fresh until a moment before you use it.Six ounces of water is easy to overestimate. If you do, the coffee that results will be weak and flavorless. I recommend that before you make your first cup of TC Decaf, you measure 6 ounces with a measuring cup, then pour that into your coffee cup to see what it looks like. Make a mental note of where the water level winds up. Then make your coffee.The Taster's Choice website, in the FAQ for this product says,"" NESCAF&Eacute; TASTER'S CHOICE Decaffeinated is decaffeinated using all natural processes."" I'm guessing that means water-process, but no guarantee.The flavor is exceedingly mild and smooth with distinct chocolate notes. I deduct 1 star in my rating, because that isn't really the kind of coffee I enjoy. I prefer a more acidic, biting flavor. But your taste may be different, in which case you can mentally add back that missing star.Will you be moved to stand outside the local coffee bar, challenging them to produce a cup of coffee as good as your Taster's Choice Decaf? I  think not. Will you sell your drip-coffee maker, your French Press and your burr grinder at a garage sale because your Taster's Choice Decaf replaces them all? Again no, not likely.

It's a peppery, sugary drink. I believe it will supply you with the necessary amounts of ginger to affect your health in a positive way. Here's the but though, because it's high in sugar, it's something that someone like I, who have higher than normal cholesterol would not want to consume too much off.So in conclusion, I liked the taste, but would prefer less sugar, or artificial sweetener.

You can always ask for water with your meal and the water always comes with ice and is free. Typically, I ask for water because I don't particularly like most soft drinks and I don't like drinking too many of them. So I just ask for water and then add a little squeeze or the water enhancer to give the water a very slight, almost imperceptible, freshening zest. Well, let's see.

I'd never had the Marcona variety before and figured this was a good way to try 'em. Have to say that their milder/sweeter taste didn't really appeal to me, and the texture is somewhat off-putting. I prefer the stronger flavor of ""regular"" almonds and the Marconas seemed relatively soft and slimy in comparison. These are moderately salted, just enough for me, but probably too much for many people. As with many salted nuts, after the second handful, the salt taste tends to dominate over the nut flavor.

So I buy roasted beans for a few months each year.  I like a strong coffee (Peets Maj.Dickinson for example). I love Community Coffee because I love New Orleans =) so it has wonderful associations for me.  But finding a dark enough roast took a few tries.  CC's dark roast is basically a medium roast - dark brown beans with just a hint of oily sheen.  However, the EXTRA dark roast (french and espesso beans) are what Peet's would call a dark roast.  This french roast bean is black/brown with a nice oily surface, slow roasted so it grinds easily, but it does not have the burnt/char after taste that I find in Starbucks French roast. It's dark and deep, with just the slightest hint of ash, but not bitter in the finish.  The aroma will drive you nuts, guaranteed!  So good smelling...  I use a Keurig with an ekobrew container and, as anyone with a Keurig knows, they brew smooth but weak.  So finding a coffee that can hold up to this type of brew without losing it's character is a challenge.  This one does.

16550,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B00H727LVA,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","Popcorn, one of the staples of American snack food and the preferred treat while watching a movie.  However, there are always seems to be new ways to flavor this timeless treat and that here is what Kernel Season's has done.  This variety pack of flavoring powder packs quite a punch without being too over powering.  There are three different flavors that come in this bundle; Ranch, Buffalo Wing and Kettle Corn.The Ranch flavor is very smooth and has a full flavor.  It has that taste of ranch one might find on a salad. The Buffalo Wing is not too hot and gives the popcorn a nice little edge.  One might think this flavor is all pepper, yet that is not the case, the flavor here is like a good bottle of hot sauce that focuses more on flavor than heat. Kettle Corn is actually very pleasant; it is sweet without being too sugary. Many times kettle corn is too sweet and mired with sugar, which could ruin the journey in flavor town.  Again, this is not the case here.I also find it refreshing that per serving, these flavoring powders aren't bogged down with sodium, calories and sugar.  In other words, if used correctly this could be diet friendly or just aid in eating well.  I will take this moment to say that these are not flavored salt; they are more of a powder based.  In addition, these could be used for other food items besides popcorn.  As a matter of fact, I enjoyed the Buffalo Wing flavor a lot more on a bake potato or French fries more than popcorn.  I would imagine the Ranch flavor would be great on some bakes or steamed vegetables.  Oh and as a side note, the Ranch and Buffalo Wing taste really good on popcorn if one were to mix them together.The only negative thing I could note about this product is when I opened each container there was a lot of empty space.  I would say almost half way empty.  I realize powder can settle, but there has to be a better way in avoiding this issue.  Nevertheless, this is a great tasting product that can be certainly used for more than just popcorn.

Fortunately, Amazon is making it right but I am saddened by this problem with planters.Jan 8, 2012: Update, for a while in 2011 there were bad patches of these nuts where for some reason the hot chili pepper was missing making the flavor subpar - there are several reviews mentioning this and I have personally experienced a few of these packs which I could not enjoy. Anyway, last week I received my latest Subscribe and Save order from Amazon and I am pleased to report that the tried and true recipe was used for that batch - dated best by 7-31-12.My favorite snack is nuts, particularly pistachios, almonds, cashews and peanuts - Yes, I know peanuts are not nuts but a legume. This particular variety of planters nuts are my favorite and can be hard to find, especially now that they have all these new designer flavors, most of which I just don't like at all. Chipotle has an aftertaste I don't enjoy and the other new flavors are too strong or too salty. The regular, honey roasted and heat nuts are the only varieties I enjoy. Heat nuts are not too hot, but certainly not mild. The hot spices heat up the taste of a roasted peanut instead of masking it.Nuts are far more nutritious than potato chips or pretzels which are mostly empty calories. Nuts are also loaded with fat, good fat, which makes you feel full instead of spiking your insulin levels like non-fat snacks do. But keep in mind a few nuts contain plenty of calories and it is easy to just keeping eating your way to the next size pants. The good news is that each packet, about 300 calories, makes for good portion control. Eat one pack and stop. Amazon has a great price and free shipping. If you like nuts and like hot and spicy, you'll love Heat Peanuts.",5,Delicious Snack at a Great Price - Read My Updates!!!,1295222400

So I decided to see what Amazon had for sale, and came across this vanilla.  My first purchase was the set Totonac has, with the three different vanillas.  One was from Mexico, one from Madasgar and one from Tahitia.  While they are all good, we all really liked the flavor this one gave to whatever I was baking.  So, when I ran out of the set, I just purchased this one vanilla, since it was our favorite.  The price is right, and you get 3 bottles, so I felt that while it is more than I would likely spend at the grocery store, I don't think it is a whole lot more, and we like it so much more!

While it definitely tastes like artificial mint despite having peppermint oil, it's not overbearing. There is only one layer of chocolate cookie, instead of two like in a standard Oreo, and it is actually thinner as well. It doesn't really taste like the cookie in the regular Oreos either - actually, it doesn't taste like much at all.All of the components in this cookie are really mediocre, but the overall sum of the parts makes it a little bit better.

Amazon's Vine program seems to have mixed up the this product with the Golden Oreo Fudge Cremes.If you're interested, I've uploaded some pictures of these cookies side by side with the Girl Scout Do-Si-Do's.These are good, but the main reason I gave them 3 stars is that they simply have no ""signature"" flavor. There's not a whole lot of peanut butter in them, so they really don't give you that peanut butter fix. Likewise, to me, they're not even as rich as a regular Oreo, and therefore really don't give much from the chocolate side, either.When you eat a regular Oreo, you know it. The cookie part is rich and has a distinct chocolate flavor different from other chocolate cookies. Unfortunately, with these Fudge Creme's the wafer is slightly different, and the fudge covering more or less masks the chocolate flavor with sweetness. It's kind of like eating a hot pepper where all you taste is hot, not the pepper. Imagine that, but subsitute sweet for hot and chocolate for pepper and you'll know what I mean.I tried them side by side with the Girl Scout's Do-Si-Do's (or Peanut Butter Patties). The girl scout cookies definitely have more peanut butter in them and it has a better flavor. The Oreo is more chocolaty, but the fudge is more waxy and doesn't melt as readily in your mouth.I'll take a regular Oreo, a nutter butter, or a Do-Si-Do over these anyday, but if none of those are available, these would do.On a separate note, my kids loved them. I didn't find them too sweet, just lacking in the ability to represent a signature flavor that sets them apart.",3,"Ok - sweet, but lacking in a distinctive flavor, March 24, 2011",1301529600

Harris ""Film aficionado""","A long time user of Knorr Sides, I've been pretty excited to sample some of the new flavors available in both their pasta and rice options. Some have been good, some not so memorable. Knorr Rice Sides are something that we prepare frequently at our home. If you want fancy cuisine, these will not fill your needs. But for the most part, these sides are quick (less than ten minutes), inexpensive (approximately a dollar each) and tasty additions when you need to add a starch to fill out your meal. They are a convenience, plain and simple. Can you find better quality alternatives? Sure. But Knorr captures a certain market and I love them for that! We have sampled just about every Knorr product known to man, we are a faithful customer.One thing I have noticed, though, following the exact instructions can sometimes lead to extra liquid remaining in the finished product. It's not so noticeable in the rice dishes, but the pastas are pretty inconsistent. So I do play around a bit with proportions.I had a chance to try three new flavors from the Knorr Rice Sides selection and while none blew me away as the next must-have flavor sensation, they fit comfortably into the Knorr family.Creamy Chipotle (4 stars): This one just sounded tasty, but I certainly wouldn't gush over the creaminess factor. The tomato chipotle sauce is surprisingly effective, and I like an option that can be paired with Mexican food aside from the usual boring choices. I would certainly put this in my rotation to keep on hand.Thai Curry (3 1/2 Stars): I was wary of the Thai Curry brand because I didn't think that Knorr would really capture such a specific flavor profile. Did they? Not particularly. This has a mild spice, at best, but still succeeds by being pretty tasty. It's not authentic by any stretch but I would definitely buy it again to accompany Asian influenced dishes.Creole Garlic Butter (3 Stars): Of the three flavors, this was the one that I was most excited about. Garlic, Cajun spices, ham, what's not to love? In truth, though, this was one of the blander and less distinct entries to my estimation. I didn't hate it, but nor would I seek it out for a specific purchase. KGHarris, 8/13.",4,Convenience At A Value Price: An Existing Knorr Customer Welcomes Three New Flavors,1375315200

As far as the benefit of the B vitamins, I think it is great to have a fortified food but have no way of really know how much is really in the product and the body really uses. It is only several B vitamins and not all of them, and I certainly noticed nothing different after consuming this Splenda for over a week.

17913,A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,B0025UCHRC,Jim,"Barilla Plus Penne is marketed as a multigrain pasta that is a good source of protein, ALA Omega-3 and fiber. The protein in Barilla Plus Penne comes from legumes, multigrains and egg whites. The Omega-3 comes from flaxseed. This penne offers 10 grams of protein per 56 gram serving (roughly 1/2 cup of uncooked penne), which can be compared to the 7 grams of protein for the same size portion of Barilla Mezze Penne, which is not a ""Plus"" variety of pasta.Barilla Plus Penne is a fairly light tasting pasta compared to some other multigrain pastas I've tried, which are often somewhat dense, heavy and chewy. Barilla Plus Penne has a richer taste than non-mulitigrain Barilla pastas (including their regular penne) and when I eat it I don't feel as if I'm giving up something in terms of flavor in order to get something in terms of health. IOW, I can substitute Barilla Plus pastas for their regular pastas without sacrificing anything in terms of flavor and texture. The instructions say to cook this pasta for 11 minutes but to give an extra minute for more tender pasta; I normally prefer al dente but probably because this is not regular white pasta it tastes better to me cooked till it's tender, tender and delicious.For me, the most important reason to eat a multigrain pasta is because of the fiber content, for I can get my protein and Omega-3 needs met more easily in other ways. I always find mulitgrain pastas more easily digestible than regular pastas and Barilla Plus pastas are no exception.Barilla is my go-to pasta brand when I shop for groceries. I prefer it to generic and store brand pastas (with the possible exception of Trader Joe's, which I've only had once and remember being impressed with) and prefer it to the similarly priced pasta brands found in supermarket pasta aisles.Most Barilla pasta sold in the US is made in Ames, Iowa using the same machines that are used in the Barilla plant in Parma, Italy. Barilla started in a bread and pasta shop in Parma in 1877 and is today part of the Barilla Group or Gruppo Barilla.

Not sure that I really like that... I just imagined giving this as a gift and then the recipient peels off the sticker and finds out that the tin was actually to contain a different type tea - not cool. It looks a bit like a cheap closeout deal, to be honest.As to the taste: It is Lipton tea in individually wrapped tea bags, nothing special.

I use the stove method. The great thing about Knorr Rice Sides is that you can add anything to it! While it is cooking for 7 minutes, you can heat in the microwave left over meat/vegetables to add to it.

I use it in multiple recipes and I feel it makes a major difference in taste. I will not substitute another brand. The citric acid type tartness gives it a special flavor.Tartar sauce: I use equal parts Duke's and sweet pickle relish. If you like it less sweet, use less relish and more mayo.Pasta salad: I package of dry ranch dressing mix, one package of J&D;'s Bacon Ranch mix and a couple of very large tablespoons of mayo. Mix well. I have seen some recipes that add Liption Onion Soup Mix to the ranch mixes, but to me, the onion is so strong, I cannot eat it (and I love onions).

It does not taste like freshly made sauce. Too much of the sauce is overwhelming, not because of the spicy factor, but just because the bottled taste would ruin good mexican food made with fresh ingredients.

45612,A26OI2JXIVZ5WZ,B005ZBZLT4,Lesley,"After reading the reviews we jumped in with both feet and ordered this and the French Roast. Here's my take on the Fog Chaser after drinking all 36 cups:* I prefer the French Roast, but I like a darker roast. This has a fruity undertone, similar to a Breakfast Blend, that I personally don't care for. But, my husband likes it and I find it drinkable.* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.* The taste is pretty strong, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like darker roasts but most people don't, and this is a little more bold than mild. There is a not-totally-pleasant aftertaste, but not enough to not drink it.* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option.

18255,A24RT6AVJXJZHF,B001OCKIP0,"John P. Thiel ""John P. Thiel""","CLUSTERS: If you're going to call them clusters they should be only a bit smaller than popped corn kernels.  These clusters are so small that you couldn't even call them that if this was cereal.  What we've really got here is a granola cereal with bits of chocolate in it to be eaten a pinch at a time.CHOCOLATE CHUNKS: Looking at the granola through the window in the packaging you would think you could hardly taste the chocolate, like when you're eating Chips A'Hoy and somehow get a cookie that only has a couple of chips in it, but you actually taste plenty of chocolate in every bite.  It's very good, not too sweet, and very chocolatey without murdering the taste of the granola--which is also delicious.WHOLE GRAIN: There are two main reasons why whole grain is good.  First, it's more filling; one sandwich made with whole grain bread is as filling as two sandwiches on white bread for example.  You simply wont feel the need to keep stuffing yourself and that will reduce your total calorie intake by hundreds of calories per day if you have whole grain snacks like this one in addition to whole grains in your meals. The other is that whole grains range from tougher to impossible to metabolize, so your body works harder, burning more calories trying to do that (calcium does this too by the way, so it's a good idea to take a swig of milk with your whole grain snack).One added feature of whole grain is that it adds volume to your stool, so make sure to have that plunger at the ready if you're suddenly adding whole grain foods to your diet.PACKAGING: If I saw this on the shelf in the supermarket I would assume it's a cereal to put milk into or to top yogurt with.  Whomever designed the packaging and omitted the word 'snack' should be flogged.WITH MILK, EATEN WITH A SPOON: Hey, guess what, it is good as a cereal.  A half cup serving, with milk, would be about 350 to 400 calories I guess, which isn't bad for breakfast.THE F-WORD: Yes, it's got fat in it, like all granola, but since it's not in bar form, molded together with marshmallows or corn syrup you really shouldn't worry about it.  'Fat is the flavor' as the saying goes, and that warning only purtains to people who somehow think one bag of cookies should be eaten in one sitting.  Even the suggested serving size here is quite large for a snack.  Personally I found myself eating two pinches of this granola whenever I went into the kitchen to feed an urge to eat something, and that was enough to do the trick.  So don't worry about the slightly over the line fat percentage.If you're really worried about gorging yourself not only on granola, but ice cream or crackers and cheese and other delicious little goodies, don't bring the whole container with you to the living room for your several hours of nightly television.  Instead, put any snack you're going to eat in a 6oz custard cup and don't fill it more than three quarters of the way--which is about half a cup since it gets wider towards the rim.BOTTOM LINE: There really isn't any supplement that can substitute for getting your nutrients and whole grains from actual food such as granola.This is really delicious, healthy, proper snack food to get you through those periods between meals when you just want to stay satiated, keep your energy level up, and reduce any cravings you might have for something bulkier and with more calories.",4,"Only one star taken off for not putting the word ""snack"" on the packaging and the clusters being too small.",1243555200
49838,A29313797NGT9L,B0081Q1KJU,Eddie Wannabee,"In a perfect world pop corn would be the size of small clouds, fluffy and filled with authentic white cheddar taste. Each kernel would be perfectly coated and it would taste exactly as it is announced to be.  For a confessed cheese pop corn addict, I have done all I could to find the perfect product. I have purchased everywhere I see a tempting bag. Regretfully, it is rare and hard to come by, when you find a superior Cheddar flavor. That does not mean I stop trying, but pretty soon I know that some bags just don't cut it.  The competition is not as fierce, as let's say, potato chips or tortillas, where you walk down the aisle and several manufacturers are competing for the hard earned dollar.Loyalty has its rewards. Some products are much better than others, and after a while the choices become much more simpler when one knows which is which that taste the best. As tedious as it is to restore the teeth back to normal after eating pop corn, it's just the one bag that calls my attention the loudest.Enter Orville Redenbacher Ready to Eat Popcorn, Sharp White Cheddar, 1.5-Ounce Each. When amazon was nice enough to send me one solitary bag, for a moment there, I was under the impression that I would have to pop it in the microwave. Soon enough I realized that this product, new to me, came from the big honcho pop corn maker. Never before knew they sell the pop corn already popped. I immediately open the bag and in no time it was gone. This is my take: the pop corn was, indeed, large, but at the bottom of the bag there was the customary little bits and pieces, which I basically do not like for now they are like tiny crumbs. The flavor of the pop corn was tasty, but lacking perhaps the sharpness I expected from the bag's description. Decent, but not spectacular. The amount in each bag is enough to get one's fix, as opposed to the larger bags, which I have a lot trouble sharing them and keeping some for next day. Basically they get consumed while watching a show on TV. I guess what I am saying is this: they are so easy to eat!I thought this product was a little better than average, it would definitely be a contender if I saw it in its large version in the aisle of snacks. I have had more cheesy than this one, but one can tell right away that Orville knows how to do pop corn. Brush, floss, whatever it takes to remove up to the last particle once done.  In the meantime they can be enjoyed very easily, to the tune of 4 Stars.",4,Pop that Corn!,1362787200

I combined it with sunflower seeds to get free shipping. The stuff is a bit different from the rolled oats I'm used to: if you try them raw, they're not tasty at all (rolled are quite pleasant: I used to mix them with yogurt and eat w/o cooking; these cut oats, otoh, raw taste like nothing, like dry cardboard). But if you cook them, it's another story: the consistency is less like glue, they're chewier and have a bit of a nutty flavour -- goes great with sunflower seeds, which I've recently discovered and put them now in the oatmeal all the time; it's a great combination, almost crunchy.One thing you need to know is that the cooking directions on the box are really incorrect: it says 2-to-1 water; bring to boil; then simmer 10-12 mins. Unless I'm doing something wrong, you'll need more water, and you'll have to simmer at least twice as long. Also, the box says a serving is a quarter cup. Come on. If you're bird, that's a serving, yes. Not being a bird, I like a big bowl of this stuff, six to eight heaped tablespoons of it dry; that's nearly 3/4 of a cup, I think -- and half the pot of water. If it still has water when ready, it's better than the opposite (burned and stuck to the walls: tastes bad plus a lot of homework cleaning the pot); and if this extra-wet condition happens, I simply turn it off and let it sit a while: it sucks in the rest of water itself, w/o cooking. 'course you can't do it all in five minutes, so I do it well ahead of time. It's not an instanteneous product: you gotta have some half an hour before you eat it.But all right: what matters is whether the stuff is good, and it is (if I discover otherwise, I'll post an update to this review). When my new stash runs out, I'll reorder, so this will be a long-term record.Added on 07/18/2011: Even though I did mention above that this is not an instant product, I underestimated the length of time required to prepare it well: it's much longer than I thought. You _can_ get it to the typical glueey consistency with an awful lot of water absorption, but it literally takes hours to get it to that state. What I do now is do it at night for the next morning: I boil water and add only three tablespoons of the stuff, bring to boil again, turn it off after a minute or so, and leave overnight. Then it's good. Otherwise it's too dry and too much unabsorbed water.01/05/2013: The price just went from 12.04 to 16.37, a 36% increase overnight. I don't think so.",5,Good product,1291248000

That being said, these are pretty good in their own right.TASTEI rather like the way these pizza crusts taste after being toasted up.  They soak in flavor from sauce or cheese well, without becoming soggy or wilted.  They have a good bread flavor on their own, also, and make a good base for a BBQ chicken or BBQ pulled pork pizza.TEXTUREI think the texture is the only thing I can complain about with these - the Schar Crusts are a little more dense than I would like.  However, this is a usual complaint about all gluten-free items.SIZEThese are definitely personal pizza sized.  With sauce, cheese, and toppings on this crust, I can usually eat about 1/2 to 3/4 of a pizza on my own.USES/ VERSATILITYIf you can expand your mind beyond making just pizza with red sauce and mozzarella, then these crusts are quite useful.

The cocoa used in this mix is smooth, dark, fruity and aromatic. Nothing else like it that I've ever tasted.Now, the criticism. There is just too much sugar in the mix. The recommended proportion of mix to 8 oz milk is four tablespoons. (By the by, there is no powdered milk in here. You must add your own milk--or soymilk or rice milk--great option for lactose-intolerant types.)People, you are using a quarter cup of mix at 4 Tbs and most of the mix seems to be granulated sugar, which you can taste and crunch in your mouth if you sample the dry mix. Cutting down fifty percent on the mix gave me an acceptable cup of cocoa but...it was no longer double chocolate and it had naturally a poorer mouth feel and aroma.Double Chocolate Mix is some of the best cocoa I WOULD have had, if Ghirardelli could see their way to making a lower sugar version, and please, no sugar substitute, which I don't like to use.Summary; great chocolate flavor, unsurpassed.

It is a delicious licorice product that improves with age, in my opinion.

If I place it in an airtight container, it remains soft, but I really love it as the texture changes.  The flavor is consistently delicious and it is now my licorice of choice.  I was expecting the box to contain a plastic bag but it simply has a plastic seal along the top of the box with nothing inside to seal.

They are delicious: each twist is about 4"" long and 5 pieces come in at about 130 calories. There are about 20 pieces per pack.  So these candies a great little pick-me-up for my desk drawer.For those of you interested in the organic aspect of Newman's Own, the good news is that the main ingredients are certified organic.  I appreciated that the 3 of the first four ingredients are certified organic (Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, & Organic Tapioca Syrup).  There is a distinction between organic and ""natural"" labels on products. Organic certification involves rigorous inspection to make sure the food source is pesticide-free, hormone-free, among other things.  The remaining ingredients were ones that I felt comfortable with eating (Corn syrup, Vegetable Gycerine, Sunflower oil, Elderberry extract--which is great for the stomach--, citric acid, Natural flavor, Pomegranate juice, and Licorice Root extract--also great for stomach ailments).To be clear, organic or otherwise, it is candy. And it has plenty of sugars in it.  But for me, when I'm dragging in the middle of a long day at work, a little piece of candy helps even out my blood sugar and holds me over until I can get home and eat dinner.The distinct flavor of Pomegranate comes through in these tastey licorice twists.

Since I read that coffee beans are one of the most pesticide-laden consumables you can buy, I've been opting for organic. I don't use any sweeteners, but usually add a good amount of whole milk. As a child I loved coffee ice cream, Haagen Daz in particular, but hardly ever have it now. This sort of reminds me of it. The flavor comes through even with the milk, without being bitter.I don't like Starbuck's French Roast (too bitter) and haven't liked any other dark roasts I've tried, so I didn't expect to like this that much. I think my tastes have been changing to prefer a more roast-driven flavor, so maybe I'd like the dark roasts I've tried better if I tried them again. Since I've had the Cameron's Organic French, I've not enjoyed the medium-roast coffees as much and had to make them stronger and use less milk to get more of the flavor I'm looking for. I tried Cameron's when the price dropped and am hoping it will drop significantly again.In the meantime, I'm expecting some varieties of Caf&eacute; Altura in my next subscribe-and-save shipment. There's a coupon available on them now. I've been using other people's reviews to try to determine what qualities I prefer and what other varieties I might like (thanks!). To my surprise, this is said to have a somewhat bittersweet profile. I'm guessing the milk cuts down on the bitterness significantly, and though I don't find this acidic, I think that some acidity, bitterness and deeply roasted flavor are necessary to make the overall flavor really pop with milk. I love all milk products, the higher the fat content, the better, and I can't imagine I'll ever want to drink black coffee.

I'm much more likely to purchase organic coffee in the first place. Combine that factor with the high quality Arabica beans and the convenience of these pods and you have a spectacular product. Also, partial proceeds of the coffee sales go toward youth soccer programs in the 'Kicks for cause foundation' that helps keep children on the playground and not in sweatshops, etc. Although these pods are not quite right for my home coffee pot (we have too many individuals who need a cup of coffee in the morning), they are fantastic for our various trips. I use these pods in place of the hotel coffee pods they provide in the room (hotel coffee is often not very good where we usually stay). The Marley Coffee pods are often far more tear resistant than the cheap hotel coffee pods. I've also used some of the packets as a unique addition to birthday gifts for friends and family (what great stocking stuffers they'll make for my coffee drinking family members). I also love to grab a  Marley Coffee pod for just a single cup of coffee in the evening if I'm going to be up late at night writing (which happens often). Another strategic place for these pods are the hiking backpacks. My husband, Tony McVay, and I can easily throw these in a small boiling pan of water if we are camping on the Mountains to Sea Trail or the Appalachian Trail on the weekends. The grains stay in the pod and haven't broke open in the pot thus far. I can't wait to share a few packets with a 'thru-hiker' on the Appalachian Trail. Imagine a weary hiker's delight when they treat themselves to a great cup of organic coffee just before hitting another long day on the trail! On that note, they are in a water-proof, light weight packet that fits easily in a backpack, purse and my husband's tool box.

13484,A19WEEGB05YAZ3,B008YUL4CQ,J. Weaver,"With the cold and flu running rampant in our household, we have become avid tea drinkers lately. I love, love, love a good jasmine tea. My favorite isSunflower Jasmine Tea 1 LB (454 g), but it is loaded with caffeine and has a strong flavor, so I can't drink it in the afternoons or evenings if I want to get any sleep at night. So Jasmine Passionfruit green tea sounded enormously appealing, save for the citrus. I am always leery of artificial citrus flavors.When I steeped my first cup of this tea, I was a little concerned that the flavors in it wouldn't be strong enough. To be honest, that fear wasn't completely allayed. I wouldn't mind if the tea were a bit stronger, but it's the sacrifice I'm willing to make for decaffeinated. My daughter, on the other hand, adds sugar to her tea. I took a sip of her cup and was blown away by how just a touch of sugar in the cup brought out a wonderful burst of flavors in the tea. The jasmine is so mild as to be almost unnoticeable. The passionfruit, however, is somewhat prominent (though by no means strong). It adds a sweetness to the tea that is enhanced by adding sugar. And whether sweetened or not, the citrus in the tea hits just the right note. You get a pleasant scent from it with just a touch of citrusy taste that washes over your tongue as you swallow.I am still resisting the urge to add sugar when I brew this tea because I just don't need the extra calories. But honestly, when I'm craving something sweet, a cup of this tea with a teaspoon or two of sugar can actually satisfy that craving. I'll definitely be brewing this again.

They were on sale, so I gave them a try and I'm so glad I did!  The thick noodles come in a pouch, and you start preparing the meal by dumping these noodles into the large styrofoam bowl and pouring in boiling water to cook them.  After a few minutes, dump out the water (the lid acts as a strainer, but be careful) and replace with fresh water and the soup base packet, along with a small packet of traditional dried Japanese goodies (green onions, fish crackers, etc.).  After a minute, the soup is done!  What is amazing is that with this short prep time, the soup still tastes like a homemade soup made with love.  It is very comforting and just makes me happy.The flavor is a complex, but very traditional, fish soup.  If you commonly eat Japanese food, you'll probably find the fish flavor very light.  A traditional American palate might find it a bit fishy, but I think you'll quickly adjust and grow to love it if you keep an open mind.  You might also consider adding vegetables and/or meat to fill out the dish a bit.  I have added shitake mushrooms to good effect.I do find these a bit expensive, but they are really in a different league than the fried noodle packs offered by the same company.

19105,A3S96B2GBP04N2,B0016B9FSU,Lisa,"Something that isn't mentioned on Amazon's webpage for Jarrow's Coconut Oil nor is it mentioned on the container is that it maybe refined Coconut Oil.  If it is not then this isn't a wonderful, coconut smelling oil which I expect with unrefined coconut oil.  The fact that it is ""neutral"" tasting maybe the key to the fact that it is refined and I'm not familiar with the term.When I opened the jar it does NOT smell like anything (hence ""neutral"") and it does NOT taste like anything which leads me to believe it is refined coconut oil.  The good thing about refined coconut oil is it has a higher smoke point (meaning it can be heated to a higher temperature before starting to burn) and it makes a good deep frying oil.  The oil is able to heat up to 360 degrees where unrefined can only be heated up to 280.  It is NOT the highest smoke point for oils (Avocado is 520, Rice Bran Oil is 490 and so forth) however most food types are deep fried at around 350 degrees so it is sufficient.This product is your basic coconut oil in my opinion and it is not the best.  The best out there is cold pressed, unrefined and organic Coconut Oil which I use to make my own margarine and use in anything I consume without cooking.  The benefits of cold press is the coconut oil retains more of it's nutritional goodness than expeller pressed oils and unrefined oils also contain more of the nutritional goodness than refined  (you can find more supporting evidence by Googling).  However cold pressed, unrefined and organic is NOT neutral smelling and it does leave behind a slightly sweet flavor in it's cooking so if you are NOT a fan of Coconut but would still like to have the benefits of Coconut Oil this sort of product maybe for you .Coconut Oil has 47.5% Lauric Acid, 18.1 Myristic Acid, 8.8% Palmitic Acid. The lauric acid and ferulic acids in Coconut Oil contribute to it's antibacterial properties making this a very healing oil which can be used for cuts and minor abrasions.Anyways I use coconut oil in both cooking and in making my own body products such as deodorant, toothpastes , lipbalm and leave in hair conditioner.  I've been a fan of Coconut oil over 8 years since I found that it is good for the thyroid and it also has many wonderful antibacterial properties.

But, what we have here is a medium/dark roasted coffee that uses the Kona bean to take the bitter, rough edges off an Extra Bold (darker roasted) style coffee. They call it Extra Bold, which it probably is...but the smooth, buttery taste of the Kona bean tames this quite a bit to make a nice, deep favored cup of coffee that is great if enjoyed black or with cream. Folks, just because it says 'Extra Bold' means that it has to be that tar-like flavored coffee that they serve at Starbucks!If you've had the pleasure of drinking a cup of 100% Estate Grown Kona coffee, you would understand this concept in your first sip of this great K-cup. As a home roaster, I buy this type of green bean in the late Fall-early Winter every year and roast up a few batches now and then for visitors to my house. Once brewed, you can drink this coffee without sugar, cream, any anything! It's sweet, buttery, silky taste is a true delight.NOW, take that taste profile of the 100% Kona bean and add a little bit of it (5%-15%) to a darker roasted coffee and you have the coffee I described above....very simple folks! Believe me, try this K-cup as you won't be disappointed if you like a mildly sweet, medium roasted, not-in-your-face heavy cup of coffee. Cheers!PS: Try this tip when you buy ANY coffee, whether it's a K-cup, or whole bean ground coffee. After you brew it, taste it black without anything added to it...I know, I know, it's a little weird, but give your taste buds a chance to acclimate to the taste. You'll be amazed how easy it is to rate a cup of coffee at this level. Once you take a few sips of it black and figure it out in your mouth, add your regular stuff and proceed as normal!...LOL.

9780,A2OCDK0BOW6UCY,B00934S312,Antigone Walsh,"Saying that something tastes good for being gluten free is not much of a  compliment. This product promises a quick and easy gluten free substitution in everyday recipes. However, my results left much to be desired and successful baking with this product requires adjustment. First, I found that spices, flavorings and leavening agents all had to be increased. Adding guar gum or xanthan help when making breads or muffins. Rule of thumb is 1/8 a teaspoon per cup of flour. Less is more so resist the temptation to dump in a lot. Substituting an egg or egg whites for a half cup of liquid boosts the protein content and helps your dough hold its shape.As with much gluten free cooking, practice makes perfect. On its own, this product is fine for breading things and seems to work best in recipes that have high moisture and sugar content. It would have been helpful if they included some tips and techniques on the package in addition to the recipes they share. While my dogs enjoyed my first batch of hockey pucks I was annoyed. Still if you are committed to a gluten free lifestyle, it will be worth you time and effort to experiment and adjust your favorite recipes accordingly.

I received this `bar' just about the time of its expiration date.  It had a distinct `crunchiness' about its shell that contained the grape filling, which meet its advertized ""crispy"" bar touting.  The `crunchiness' really did not distract from the product, as it wasn't `hard' from the sense that one had to force a bit through it - just a little more crunchy that what I was expecting.

It's suppose to indicate how many squeezes to flavor X amount of water.  What's one squeeze?  You could eject half the contents of the bottle out with one squeeze if you wanted to.

It has been a bit difficult trying to recruit the whole family when it comes to choosing water based drinks over soda and juices.  This little bottle was the beginning.At first glance the bottle seemed a bit too small; after the realization that it should only be a 1-2 second squeeze, the size made more sense.  For my tastes it was a bit too sweet and peachy.  My husband and children on the other hand, loved it!!  The family went through a lot of water that week.  My husband would hog the little bottle.  There lies the issue on what constitutes ONE squeeze of two.  Everyone's squeeze was completely different.  The bottle didn't make it past the week.  There was a lot of over squeezing for those that love their drinks to be sickeningly sweet.Highly recommend if you currently live Linton tea and iced tea products.  We tried the peach flavor and even though it was too intense for myself; it was thoroughly enjoyed by the other four I individuals in our home.  If you find that you struggle with plain water then you might want to give these enhancers a try.

In the US, companies are only required to list MSG on the ingredient label as MSG if it is a pure form of free glutamate.2. It is true that this product does not contain pure MSG.3. Many of the ingredients listed contain VERY high levels of MSG (free glutamate), and are included BECAUSE they contain MSG.4. Both Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate are also included, which are pretty expensive to add, and are only added because they enhance the effects of MSG--they do nothing else. If Kernel Seasons really did not include MSG, there would be no point in adding these other additives (and it would be much cheaper not to add them).Some people choose to eat foods with MSG, and that's ok.  White Cheddar used to be my favorite Kernel Season's flavor before I learned how to read ingredient labels carefully.  If MSG doesn't bother you, go ahead and buy this if you want.  My husband is severely allergic to MSG, though, and when we were first learning to avoid MSG, labels like this caused him to be very sick.

I've had a lot of fun & success with the different granola recipes - which have been great as snacks, breakfast or in lieu of oatmeal when I make bread in the bread machine. One of the more intriguing ones called for Pistachios - a nut I had never tried before - mainly because they looked messy, hard on the hands to shell & I wasn't sure the color was natural. Also, there have been a few very pretty biscotti recipes that called for Pistachios I'd like to try.The pistachios I found in the store were very expensive for itty bitty bags. When I found these on the Amazon site, I decided to give them a try. Whoa - these are way too good right out of the bag! Once my 20-something kids found them hidden in the bakery section of the kitchen, the level in the bag diminshed so quickly that to actually get any of the baking done I'll have to order more right away!I have no experience but general nut-eating to gauge their quality by. I found them to have a pleasing nutty & salty scent, a softer bite than a peanut or cashew, and a buttery taste similar to a cashew. Their green color was basically uniform throughout the bag. The bag is heavyweight and its ziplock seals like most of its kind (requiring a bit of finger fumbling to get open or closed again).

Mine was shipped with part of my Amazon Mom order. 3 plastic jars of this, in a sealed thin plastic bag, that was just tossed in the box with stuff for my 9 month old daughter. The only protective packing they even attempted was a long piece of brown paper, because they apparently believed the story of paper beating rock. Well, the box was then abused, probably because there was not a single warning on it that it contained something that could easily break and cause a mess. So, of course, the thin plastic jars busted and leaked to their little hearts' content all inside the thin plastic bag they were sealed in. It was like a little chili garlic sauce goldfish sack. Then, being the level of worthless thin plastic bags will be in situations such as this, my chili garlic sauce goldfish sack leaked all over the rest of the stuff shoved in the box- because washing super spicy sauce off of all the items and food meant for my 9 month old child is my favorite weekend activity.Amazon has been kind enough to replace the chili garlic sauce portion of my order- we will see if they arrive in a more acceptable and usable manner- and apparently duck-all to my annoyance and less than stellar experience, as well as the rest of my now violated order.",3,"The sauce is delish and fantabulous- find some, get some, buy some!

It has a rich buttery smell, and it seems like they clarify it a little less because it's slightly grainy when you taste it at room temperature.That said, I find myself buying the Purity Farm ghee because this brand is almost twice as expensive and while it has the edge in taste, it is very very slight and not worth the big premium to me. It might be worth it if I was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread, but I usually use regular butter for that, and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor.

A google search can be hard to find a good source given the amount of salesmanship surrounding this type of product.  However, I felt the livestrong website had a well-sourced write up ([...]).  Having only had one bottle to sample, the long term benefits are not my concern for the purposes of this review.What I did notice right away was that this water does actually have a unique taste -- as subtle as water tastes can be.  I thought it was actually quite pleasant and clean -- certainly better than the filtered tap water that comes out of my fridge.  The electrolytes, which can sometimes have an oily taste, are undetectable.The hydration factor is noticeable to me.  I would go out on a limb and say that it may even surpass the hydration factor of electrolyte water on its own (which can be made easily by buying electrolyte packs to add to water).Now, is the hydration factor and *potential* long term health benefit something that's worth more than double the price of, say, Poland Spring?  That's up to you.  There's not a lot of information surrounding how much of this stuff you'd need to drink to see health benefits.  So using it as a long term product might get quite expensive.

When it comes to a healthy, satisfyingly crunchy snack with some good nutritional value, I just don't think anyone can go wrong with popcorn, and with the WIDE variety of flavors that Kernel Season offers, I really can't imagine anyone that likes crunchy snacks would grow weary of popcorn before a full two weeks has gone by, with each day offering up a different flavor!These three cheesy flavors are very tasty, independent of each other. Heck, they might even be worth combining (which hadn't occurred to me until just now)! Each flavor has an appetizing smell, and a good taste that pairs well, both with popcorn, as well as steamed veggies. There's enough salt here, as well, that you'll neither want nor need to add extra salt for a good, savory, salty snack/veggie to enjoy. You might want to angle the container as you shake, though, to keep rising steam from entering the seasoning bottle & gumming up the works...The containers are large enough that you'll get plenty of use from each of these shaker-topped seasoning bottles, and I think most any popcorn fan is likely to come back for more.

40671,A3SX5MZTCZRQLF,B000F3V880,Bradford Schmidt,"Let me open by explaining something: I believe that good cooking requires some subtlety.  A little restraint perhaps.  But there's a school of cooking that seems to think that all you really need to make good food is to either a) deep fry it or b) pour a hell of a lot of sauce all over it.  The actual food you're cooking seems to be fairly unimportant, taking a back seat to the fry-a-lator or the sauce-o-squirter.  Fischer & Weiser Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce would fit right into a kitchen like that.It's not that it tastes bad, because it doesn't - not really anyway. The ginger flavor comes through fairly well (and I like ginger) and it finishes with a well balanced heat that's on the mild side, but nice all the same.  Those aren't the problems.  The real issue is that it's that it's absurdly sweet. As in candy sweet.  As in ""forget tasting what you're pouring it on"" sweet. And it's thick too. Which is neither here nor there (I don't have any real preference in that regard) but it's relevant if you don't want WAY too much sauce on what you happen to be flavoring.On the upside, it's made with sugar; no corn syrup (high fructose or otherwise) fouls the bottle. And I did like the underlying flavors, so if you dig really sweet and thick sauces, you may well enjoy this (and hence my two star rating).For me though, I'd have to agree with the (really poorly printed) label when it refers to this product as a ""finishing and dipping sauce""; dipping food I'm eating in this sauce would pretty much finish it for me.",2,Overly Sweet; Lacks Any Subtlty,1237939200

I have a latte almost every morning and then regular coffee later in the day. I chose to receive the medium-dark roast Community Coffee, Caf&eacute; Special, pre-ground. I received 4 lbs. and have been very happy with this coffee. I noticed right away that it has a slight chocolate aroma. Since when I travel, I often get gas station coffee which I mix 1/3 cacao and 2/3 coffee, this was a plus for me. The Community coffee medium-dark roast is not a strong coffee and it has no bitterness at all. It is rich without the bitterness. I found that with Community Coffee I needed to add about 1/3 more coffee to my coffee maker in order to get the strength I am used to with my usual coffee. My usual coffee is an organic coffee which I grind to about medium grind (Mind, body and soul), I generally use about one scoop per 6 cups with my usual coffee. I have not found anything any better this this organic, but Community Coffee is very good and I could easily give it 5 stars, it was a toss-up. I should add that I tend to drink my coffee with cream or flavored cream. This will likely be an important point for those who drink it black.As an aside, I will also add that according to Sanjay Chopra, Deepak's brother, both of whom are well known doctors, that a couple of cups of coffee a day will prevent kidney disease.

You dump the packet of S&B into a large ziplock bag, lightly wet the chops with water, and then shake each chop in the baggie. Then you put the chops in the oven for 20 minutes (15 was not enough) and don't turn them, leave them on one side. The pork comes out nicely cooked and the breading is tasty. Shake 'n Bake is a good product and an inexpensive way to introduce variety to your suppers when you use pork chops and cutlets. We will probably try the S&B packets for chicken and other meats too.",5,A nice surprise and something new,1314921600

At work, I use it every day to make coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc., from the K-cups.  I have never made sweetened iced tea until I received the Lipton K-Cups, REFRESH Iced Sweet Tea, from the Amazon Vine Program.  These K-cups are simple to use.  After thoroughly shaking the K-cup, I inserted it into my Keurig Mini, brewed its contents into a ceramic mug, and then poured the hot liquid into an insulated thermos full of ice.  Immediately, I began drinking the tea.Surprisingly enough, the Lipton REFRESH Iced Sweet Tea tasted exactly like fresh brewed ice tea.  It was sweet, but not overly sweet like the sweetened tea I sometimes get at Chick-fil-A or Taco Bell.  Drinking their sweet tea is like consuming a mouthful of sugar.  Neither did it have a bad aftertaste.  In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I turned around and inserted another K-cup into my Keurig Mini.

When I do add sugar, I would put no more than a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar in my cup of coffee. I also will generally choose a dark roast coffee, like French Roast or Sumatra.This illy Caffe coffee drink is an Italian Roast coffee. It has a decent taste in my opinion. I was expecting some sort of ""canned"" taste but didn't sense that at all while I was drinking it. But I did experience an aftertaste that I can only describe as somewhat metallic.I usually drink the dark roast coffees but was surprised to find that this had a really  nicely balanced coffee taste without the pronounced bitterness usually associated with the bigger, bolder dark roasts to which I'm accustomed.It was the added sugar that I don't really care for. The serving size is 6.8 fluid ounces and that contains 10g of sugar. A teaspoon of sugar is approximately 4 g which means this 6.8 oz can of coffee has the equivalent of 2.5 teaspoons of sugar. Even if I did put sugar in a cup of coffee, I'd only put in a single teaspoon. So for me it was way too sweet. Knowing that many people do sweeten their coffee, I'd say that many people would not find this as overly sweet as I did. You'd probably like it if you sweeten your coffee.I find it convenient to be able to have with you on trips or travels, a good quality cup of coffee. This tastes much better to me than your typical gas station swill that is passed on as coffee. So for trips or commutes it would be a great choice.

17379,A2U77Z3Z7DC9T9,B004VLVIL4,"Ronald M. Chavin ""rmchavin""","Scientific studies have shown that wheat bran has greater health benefits than oat bran, corn bran, and all other brans except rice bran, which contains the healthiest combination of phytonutrients.  However, because rice bran always contains a small amount of arsenic, most people prefer to eat wheat bran regularly instead of rice bran.As for wheat germ versus wheat bran, they are both extremely healthy for us to eat but overall, wheat bran is substantially healthier for us to eat than wheat germ.  However, wheat germ is substantially more delicious than wheat bran.  Also, 1 ounce of wheat germ is richer in minerals and phytosterols than 1 ounce of wheat bran.  However, 100 calories of wheat bran contains just as much if not more minerals and phytosterols as 100 calories of wheat germ.Eating wheat bran regularly will substantially lower our risk of developing all cancers, heart disease, and a dozen other killer diseases.  Wheat bran is definitely superior to wheat germ for people who want to lose weight because (1)wheat bran is much, much lower in calories than wheat germ, which is very high in fat, and (2)wheat bran provides more food for the weight loss-causing good bacteria in our intestines than wheat germ.Fiber constitutes 66.3% of the carbohydrates in wheat bran.  That's higher than almost any other commonly eaten food.  Insoluble fiber comprises about eleven-twelfths of the total fiber in wheat bran.  A very beneficial group of soluble fibers known as, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), constitutes the remaining one-twelfth.  Fiber constitutes about 35% to 60% of the carbohydrates in legumes, which are even more beneficial to our health than wheat bran.  However, all legumes tend to cause way too much flatulence because they contain way too much fermentable starches (such as raffinose) in addition to flatulence-reducing phytate.  Because wheat bran is high in flatulence-reducing phytate and low in flatulence-causing fermentable starches (such as raffinose), wheat bran tends to minimize flatulence in the vast majority of people.Bob's Red Mill does an excellent job of preserving the health benefits of wheat bran in this product by tampering with nature as little as possible.  However, because mycotoxin-producing fungi love to eat whole grains, seeds, and nuts, I strongly recommend that wheat bran be kept in an airtight container, preferably with a dessicant inside to keep the humidity as low as possible.  It's not necessary to do this before the clear, plastic bags that come with this product are cut open.",5,Only rice bran has healthier phytonutrients than wheat bran,1382313600

27414,A7A7M5I3950OH,B0051SU0OW,Charles S.,"So, you basically want to know; which of these 3 options is the best? The simple, straightforward answer is that this one, the ekobrew, is the best.I have used all 3 extensively. While all 3 do the job, there are caveats to each one.1. The My K-Cup works well, but you have to remove the k-cup holder from your brewer, so if you (like me) like to switch back and forth between regular K-cups and a basket, this is a bit of a pain. And Keurig's little filter baskets are not terribly durable, either. It also has 3 separate pieces to clean, so it's a bit fiddly compared to the other two, which are both one-piece units. But, little details aside, it works well and makes a good cup of coffee.2. The solofill works pretty good, but is more difficult to clean than the ekobrew, and it doesn't hold quite as much coffee as the other 2 devices. Still, a good effort, and makes a decent cup.3. The ekobrew hit it right on the head. Easier to clean, excellent capacity, and it just feels like it's a higher quality product than the solofill. So, the ekobrew is the one for me.My ratings are thus: 5 stars for the ekobrew, 4 stars for the solofill, and 3.5 stars for the Keurig My K-Cup.",5,ekobrew vs. Solofill vs. My K-Cup,1315872000

So, his options for chocolate are limited.For chocolate chip cookies, we used to chop up85% Lindtbars (70% Lindt bars contain soy lecithin), to make our own ""chocolate chips.""  It wasn't very good, though, because chocolate chips don't taste as good when they're so dark.Then, one of my grocery stores started to carry these chocolate chips.  They are GREAT!  But, to me, since they're mini chips they tend to blend in, so you don't taste them as much when you eat the cookies.  We used to buy these a whole lot, and then we discovered theEnjoy Life Semi Sweet Chocolate Mega Chunks, and now we've switched to buying those.  They are absolutely PERFECT for chocolate chip cookies.I was kind of skeptical--would these still taste as good as other chocolate chips?? My husband and I agree that they do!  To us, they taste just the same as regular chocolate chips.  My husband loves to snack on the chocolate chunks straight from the bag, so we go through a lot of those--about a bag every week.I recommend these (and the chunks) to anyone who can't have (or doesn't want to have) soy lecithin.  My husband definitely doesn't react to these chocolate chips--and he's had enough of them that we would know.

I'm not that into cucumbers, but I'm not against them either, and they do have good anti-inflammatory properties (particularly if they are organic, or at least well-washed and at least partially peeled).

As far as I know they are a trusted name in foods.I never had the ""French"" green lentils but after a show by Laura Caulder I had to try them. I understand these are not from the reigon of France that the more costly ""Le Puy"" green lentils are grown. But honestly, they are around $17.50 for a little over a pound (that includes shipping) so let's try these first.These are smaller than the dark lentils I am used to. They didn't break down or give off a soupy or starchy texture either. They retain a bite... ""to the tooth"" texture after proper cooking time. I went ahead and followed the directions, added sauteed onions and garlic, toasted walnuts and chevre. Topped with fresh thyme and a drizzle of walnut oil. Very, very good.I think a lentil smoked sausage soup is in my future.When these are gone,(I stored them in my freezer like it says to) I will have already tried the Le Puy lentils.

You are undoing the health benefits of the dark chocolate inside by eating the pure calories of the sugar shells.  That said, they're tasty and fun as when you were a child (though also the same choking hazard). The bags are quite large (hand-sized) so be sure to have a dispenser or container/candy dish to store the candies as you won't want to leave an open bag laying about. A serving is about a handful but you'll find that a handful of dark chocolate M&Ms and a glass of fat-free (skim) milk is more healthful than chocolate milk in a container premixed.

9607,A18OTEA6ICZTJY,B004727NK2,"Pattidkrause ""believer""","I'm working on eliminating gluten from my diet. Being a bread and pasta lover, the possibilities for finding a good tasting gluten-free substitute was daunting. After reading the reviews for Tinkyada products I tried the elbow and spiral pastas. Originally I followed the cooking instructions exactly because I'd read that gluten-free pasta doesn't hold together as well as pasta containing gluten. I found that cooking the pasta for the full time is okay, but it tends to fall apart a bit when being mixed for pasta salad. The taste is great but I like my pasta to stay somewhat intact. Through experiments with cooking time I found that a cooking time of 12 minutes, from adding the spiral pasta to the already boiling water, gets much better results. The instructions call for 16 minutes, but 12 minutes leaves the pasta with just enough texture to be ""al dente"" and hang together in my ""famous"" pasta salad. Also, frequent stirring during the cooking helps enormously.The elbows are somewhat brown from the bag, but cook up to a nice cream color, so it doesn't appear to be a whole grain pasta, which causes some picky eaters to turn up their noses. So my pasta love is no longer thwarted by ""gluten-free!""And, for those looking for good gluten-free bread, I highly recommendChebe Bread Original Cheese Bread Mix, Gluten Free, 7.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 8)mixes!!!

Generally, I'm okay to eat a cup of yogurt or granola bar to keep my cravings quashed and energy level up. I drink protein shakes regularly every morning, but they aren't practical for the work place, which is why this drink appealed to me. I thought it would be convenient, as well as good for me, and make me feel less hungry at the same time. I tried it and I have to say, it wasn't that bad. I suppose it is a convenient package of vitamins and nutrients, but looking at the label, I think it is a little high in carbs (though mercifully, low in fat). I don't like soy based drinks at all, and I am okay with a little caffeine now and then, but this drink has neither. I have to say though, about halfway through the 11 ounce bottle, I'd pretty much had enough. It is just not that good and was almost hard to swallow. I might be willing to try some of the other flavors available, if the price point was right, but I would say I'm probably more likely to stick with my morning shake and mid-morning snack, and take a pass on this.

I (also) just got off the phone with a Gevalia sales rep (yes, while drinking their coffee...ha) - I had come here intending to give a 5-star rave about these K-Cups and saw all of the negative reviews. Some were rather concerning.Personally I haven't had any issues with the K-Cups, and I know people who have long enjoyed them. That said, reports of grounds in coffee, water backing up and even broken machines needed some investigation. I called Gevalia's customer service line, and recounted what I had saw here. It seems that Gevalia is WELL aware of the issues with their K-Cups - I was told by the rep that they had go so far as to ask customers to send in samples of everything for review. To their credit, they seem to be actively working on a solution. A mark against them, however, is that they didn't recall these cups long ago when the first reports of broken machines came back to them. When asked about whether they would redesign the cups to avoid further issues, the CS rep was unable to tell me.Now I usually won't deduct stars on account of other people's experiences, but since Gevalia (Kraft) has confirmed that they are very ware of this problem, I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending this product with five stars - I would feel terrible if someone bought them on my recommendation only to have their Keurig explode!Now, on to the blend itself. This is where Gevalia wins full marks from me. I usually prefer dark roasts (and even espresso roasts for french press) but as far as medium roasts go, this is by far one of my favorites. It presents a nice full body for a medium roast, and though my wife and I agree that it doesn't have a complex flavor it is certainly well-rounded and without bitterness (as promised). It does have a slight acidity (what coffee connoisseurs would describe as ""brightness""), but it is by no means unpleasant.So do I recommend it? If I could switch the coffee inside this Gevalia into another pod without hassle, I would do it in a second. The taste is delicious, simply a pleasure to drink. The concerns I have about potential damage to my brand new Keurig are quite real.I will be following up on my phone call with Gevalia in a month or two - if they haven't redesigned or recalled a specific batch by then it's very possible I won't be purchasing their K-Cups again. I will update this review at that time, but I really hope that they take to heart what their customers are saying!Taste: 9/10Aftertaste: 9/10Cost-effectiveness: 8/10 ($0.70/cup)Reliability: 2/10I cannot recommend them at this time, pending progress from Gevalia.",3,Five-star taste in a one-star cup.,1371513600

I'm not allergic to any of those, but nonetheless after consuming about a half cup of these as a snack in the afternooon and at bedtime, I woke up with a headache, upset digestive system and other unpleasantness. Considering all the accusations regarding poisoned pet and for-human products that are Chinese-grown, made or processed, which have been in the news over the last few years, I can't help but worry about these seeds.

Because it is not a thick product, it stirs up easily.  It appears to be pretty fresh.

While there is no doubt more fiber in your diet is good for you, do we really need it in a sweetner?  Well, I guess I will take it where I can get it, provided it is cost effective and does not alter the taste of my coffee from what I have become accustomed to with original Splenda.  This product does an excellent job in that regard.While we all interpret taste somewhat differently, I found Splenda with fiber to be an excellent substitute to Splenda without fiber in regard to taste.  In fact, I believe it taste better than the original, more akin to raw cane sugar in your coffee, which I like but you may not.  So, in short, I can increase my fiber intake while making my coffee taste better. The ""sweetness ratio"" is about the same- packet for packet.  So, if you are using 3 packets of original Splenda in your coffee, you will more likely than not (depending on individual taste), use the same number of packets with this product.  Currently, the price point is not too far off original Splenda so I find this alternative reasonable.

This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lidsRe-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machineand my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.

Don't get me wrong- my cats enjoy katsuobushi- but I definitely prefer using this for human cuisine.This is a lot of katsuobushi.  I was able to store the majority of this in two 1/2 gallon mason jars (Ball Wide Mouth Half Gallon Jars with Lids and Bands, Set of 6), which I then vacuum sealed, to preserve the freshness for long term storage.  Any excess I keep in a plastic bag, for immediate use.I was immediately pleased with the size of the flakes/shavings.  They were very large, with very little dust.  Normally we buy katsuobushi in the small 1-2 serving plastic packets, where the flakes are usually very small, crumbled, and overpriced.  This large package was a godsend.We use this in our house to add a bright flavorful end note when topping/garnishing okonomiyaki, takoyaki, yakisoba, and tofu dishes.  Katsuobushi is also an important ingredient when making certain Japanese broths.  For moms having trouble getting their kids to eat their white rice, sprinkling some katsuobushi and furikake (chopped dried nori (seaweed), sesame seeds, pinch of sugar, salt) can make rice a world more interesting.  Growing up on this, white rice with katsuobushi+furikake is a big comfort food for me.  Great stuff!",5,"Fun cat treat, but better for human consumption",1358121600

28804,A30ZWHKMYS67CM,B000SAPXEU,Lazychick,"I've recently been spoiled by Teavana, after finding some blends that I like, but was looking for something that I could drink at night and without having to worry about going through it so much, and I wanted something that I knew was organic. My favorite Davidson's herbal blend so far is the Herbal Cranberry Orange, but I wanted to try their Chamomile/Tulsi version, especially since I love chamomile and know tulsi/holy basil is really, really good for you. I've had Organic India's Tulsi Green, which I really liked, but it was a bit too pricey for what you got (and I hated the container).This tea is pretty good, but I'm still trying to find my preferred method to make it, because I don't really care for the slight mint flavor. The mint was a bit of a surprise, even though it's subtle, since I never really detected it in other tulsi teas, and I'm not too fond of mint flavors, but it's growing on me. And, yes, I realize it's technically part of the mint family; I just never had issues with it before--or maybe it's just the blend. I may try mixing it with rooibos or the like, since I liked that blend with the Organic India version--though not sure how that'll do with chamomile. At least it's fun to experiment, mmk. :)For the amount you get--which is almost ridiculously generous--and it being organic, it's certainly a great price. My mouth actually dropped when I first got the bag because it was so much bigger looking when compared to other 1-pound bags I've received before. I just wish it had a little more citrus or something to it, but it's definitely not bad, and it's certainly great for health purposes. It's growing on me! It would be nice if Amazon offered Davidson's smaller or sample-sized bags to try, which I just recently found out is on their site; I'm just not keen on the shipping--still, I may start consider ordering from there on questionable blends I'm not sure I'll like.Because there's so much in the bag, it's inexpensive, and I am not likely to drink it several times a day, I also started doing facial steams with it, using the not-so glamorous method of towel-tenting-it over a bowl. It does a great job on the skin, from what I can tell (better than just regular water, I've noticed), and the smell is heavenly. It's almost earthy and relaxing in a way.",4,Not Bad and Great Price,1366588800

41884,A3HNXZZDEICO57,B0051SU0OW,jeninmaine,"When I received my Keurig for xmas I got myself one of their reusable basket filters, the kind that comes with a plastic assembly that the filter sits inside of.  At first I thought it was great but over time I found it fiddly to use, prone to being messy, and probably the most vexing was that it wasn't easy to make multiple cups for company.  The outer sleeve gets very hot and was difficult to handle without letting it cool first.  I also hated having to remove part of the machine so that it would fit.I finally decided to try something new and saw the Ekobrew here on Amazon so I bought the four-pack as it was the best deal.  From the very first time I used one it clearly set itself head and shoulders above the Keurig filter.  It's just one piece, it fits into the machine without having to remove the K-cup holding apparatus, it sits right in there and all you have to do is line up the bottom or the top so that the puncturing needle fits into one of the recesses on the bottom of the Ekobrew.Cleanup is so easy - the plastic cools off quickly and it's easy to tap out the grounds and give it a quick hand wash or rinse and then it's ready to use again.  I like having more than one as I can make multiple cups of coffee at a time.  They take up very little room (again as opposed to the Keurig filter) and open and close easily.  The only thing that might not be durable in the long haul is the plastic hinge, but even if that broke you could still close the lid securely and use it.I really like these filters so much better than the Keurig, and have recommended them to all of my friends who have a machine.",5,LOVE these!,1371513600

18220,A1F7SX3GNVBNE3,B00GNU6MFI,"Joshua G. Feldman ""Technophile""","I didn't catch the Dr. Oz segment, but I did read the sole double blind peer reviewed paper &#34;Yacon syrup: beneficial effects on obesity and insulin resistance in humans.&#34; published in Clinical Nutrition 2009 Apr;28(2):182-7. doi: 10.1016/j.clnu.2009.01.013.  The results were encouraging in that single small study.  Clearly more work needs to be done so we can know empirically if this is really effective and how broadly.  The mechanism by which it works is fructooligosaccharides which the yacon tuber are rich in - a type of sugars not well digested by the stomach but nutritious to gut bacteria.  The idea is that yacon syrup makes you feel like you've eaten a sweet, while inulin water soluble fiber fills you up a bit, and while encouraging gut bacteria which increase the efficiency of your GI tract and producing a mild laxative effect (in the manner of most semi-digestible sugar substitutes) .Some warnings are necessary: use the recommended dose: 1 tsp per serving, max 3x/day.  More isn't better as it can cause gastric problems like gas, bloating, diarrhea.  I stuck to the dose and didn't have any problems.  I suspect some of the negative reviews here might have resulted from people not measuring, or using too much.I received a bottle as a review sample.  Here's what I found taking 1 teaspoon 3x daily 15-30 minutes before meals as recommended.1) The syrup itself is a dense viscous dark prune colored opaque liquid.  It has the aroma of figs and prunes and the flavor of concentrated black fruits (figs and prunes again) and a bit of molasses flavor too.2) I found the flavor strong but not objectionable.  Once again: prune/fig concentrate and molasses.  I actually rather enjoy the flavor, but it's a strong flavor.3) Body effects.  Immediately upon taking it I could feel as a warmth in my stomach.  The inulin (water soluble fiber) will absorb water from the surrounding environment, so be sure to drink a glass of water with your Yacon syrup dose.  It's sweet and sticky - so you'll want to anyway - but be sure you do.  It's part of the benefit.  The fiber absorbs water and creates a slight sensation of fullness.  However, I found that the sweetness produced an insulin response that gave me appetite.  This fits well with the advice to take it right before eating.  Like drinking a diet soda, Yacon tells your body you've had a sweet and provokes insulin release without providing it many sugars to actually metabolize.  Eating your meal afterwards takes care of that.4) Laxative effect - very slightly noted.5) Weight loss.  I had been eating in a more rational way (trying to only eat enough to satiate but not to feel full) and had been losing weight even before I started taking Yacon syrup.  But the syrup seems to have accelerated my weight loss.  I lost 9 pounds over the month I've been taking Yacon syrup.All in all these stuff seems easy to use, effective, and unlike a lot of weight loss supplement strategies not based on potentially dangerous stimulants or voodoo.  I like that the active ingredient, fructooligosaccharides, work via enhancing intestinal fauna - a probiotic effect that has other health benefits as well.  This seems a holistic and beneficial approach.  Be aware of the issues around over consumption (bloating and regularity) and have realistic expectations.  But I can easily recommend this.  I'm going to to keep taking it, personally.  It's working for me.",5,Good quality Yacon syrup: a tantalizing product for weight loss and intestinal health.,1396569600

I was told to stay on a low fiber/no meat diet for a while.  They suggested pasta and rice as a base.  When I saw this I thought...it's Barilla...how bad can it be.  It was pretty darn good with a little drizzle of quality olive oil and parm cheese sprinkled on top.  Now I can eat seafood and right away thought about this with sauteed shrimp and fresh garlic tossed in.  As usual, I checked for the product on Amazon and see they've got a 4 pack available through Subscribe and Save....my favorite way to shop.I'm looking forward to trying the shrimp dish. While the tortellini is cooking I'll quickly saute fresh shrimp and chopped fresh garlic in a little olive oil and a small pat of butter for rich flavor. Toss that into the cooked pasta and top with a little grated cheese.....yummy!!!!!  Can't wait to add veggies to this dish.  One bag serves 4 or, if you're a robust eater, provides 2 REALLY generous servings.

The price is high because low-carbers are desperate for sweets that won't add much to their daily carb intake; and Low carb specialties (the makers of these bars) know it. I've purchased these bars twice before and loved them; but I took the price personally.  Yes, it's true, no one forced me to purchase them, but that's besides the point.  You end up feeling like prey every time you see the price of your favorite items through the roof when you're desperate for something sweet.

20218,A27Q1X75QCWTID,B007JFXWRC,Louise Llama,"I have not been a big fan of the Lipton brand teas over the years because I grew up with it being the only tea in the house.  It always had a bitter aftertaste to me.  I have noticed over the years however that Lipton has been coming out with different and innovative flavors so I was happy to try this Blackberry Vanilla herbal tea.This is an herbal tea so it is caffeine free.  If you are looking for healing properties of teas such as green and black you won't get it here.  You WILL get a lovely blend of fruit and flower leaves for a relaxing hot beverage or a refreshing cold beverage morning, noon or night.Here are the ingredients in the order they are listed on the package:Hibiscus Flowers, Rosehips, Sweet Blackberry Leaves, Natural Flavor, Dried Black Current Pieces, Dried Blackberry Pieces, Dried Blueberry Pieces, Dried Raspberry Pieces, Sunflower Lecithin.The ingredients all sound nice and healthy except for the ""Natural Flavor"".  I have an issue with this term.  What exactly is ""Natural Flavor""?  According to the US Federal Code of Regulations it is this:""The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products therof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"".So, I called Lipton and asked what exactly is the ""natural flavoring"" in this product.  The nice representative asked ""well, do you have an allergy to certain ingredients because if you tell me what you are allergic to I can see if I can find out?""  So, I said ""well, how about you just tell me what the natural ingredient is outright so I can just determine if that is the ingredient I should stay away from?""  The rep then asked me for the barcode on the package.  I gave it to her and she then answered ""According to the FDA""...  then proceeded to give me a statement similar to the US Federal Code of Regulations above.  I politely interrupted the rep and told her I was familiar with what the FDA defines as ""natural flavoring"" but that didn't help me to determine what specific ingredient could cause an allergic reaction.  She then said that I could get my doctor to send a letter on official doctor practice letterhead stating my known allergies and only then would the company disclose to my DOCTOR the source of the ""natural flavoring"".  Interesting yes?  So, keep that in mind with this product or any product that lists ""natural flavoring"" as an ingredient folks.I WAS happy however to see that Sunflower Lecithin is used instead of Soy Lecithin.  Soy Lecithin is full of GMO's and Sunflower (at this time) is not.  Its used in products as an emulsifier.  The other issue I have with the ingredient list is that Vanilla is not listed among them.  The tea is labeled as Blackberry AND Vanilla.  Where does the vanilla essence come from?Moving on from the ingredient list, lets talk about the tea bag.  The tea is packed in an innovative triangle shaped mesh bag.  The box states that this design is to provide more room for the fruit and herbs to infuse.  This might be true.  The tea did not need to steep nearly as long as the traditional flat papery bag.  However, the Triangle Mesh bag is made of plastic and is not biodegradable.  I asked Lipton about this as well and was told  ""The translucent Pyramid tea bag is made of PET, the same food grade material clear water and juice bottles are made of.  As with any plastic, it would not be considered biodegradable.  PET is completely safe and is 100% recyclable within the plastics waste stream.""  Great, so more plastic that will not decompose in our waste dumps.  Who is really going to empty out each of these bags and put them in your home recycle bin or take them to your local recycle facility?  Lipton is environmentally IRRESPONSIBLE!If you don't have an issue with any of what I addressed above then you will be happy to know that the tea itself is good.  If I didn't have an issue about the packaging or Natural Flavorings then I would give it 5 stars.  The flavor is deep and intense. The Berry flavor is predominant as is the Hibiscus but the Vanilla was difficult to ascertain.  It is good hot or cold.  I added some mulling spices to a hot cup last night and it was a very nice alternative to mulled apple cider or wine.I will be looking for different alternatives to this tea.

Almost all the candy you buy has it in it. M&Ms; have it - IN THE CHOCOLATE. Most chocolate cake mixes have it, but worse... all that red candy you get from your classmates? Yeah... it has it too. Luckily, his sister will usually trade him for things that he can have and the families that we know will try to make sure he gets something (like one specifically got green fun dip for him - I mean, how sweet is that?). We always give away little party favor toys or something and skip the candy all together, but...He had been really down about the candy issue and Valentine's Day and I went looking for something he could have. Surely, there's a red hard candy that doesn't have red40 in it, right? Yeah, you'd be surprised... it's not easy to find, but I ran across this product and ordered it. As a bonus, it has a good chunk of Vitamin C, doesn't use HFCS (all natural sugars and other ingredients). Sold! But, will it be nasty? Oh well, we had 150 lollipops to find out!... and they are good. REALLY good, they are just the right amount of sweet and tartness. I had to move them off the counter because I kept dipping in there myself. My son LOVES them. He can have strawberry flavored candy again. I know this sounds simplistic and overly dramatic, but when you are 9, it can be really depressing. But yeah, he has to share with the rest of the family too because we are all hooked.Thanks, YummyEarth.

Only problem is that each pyramid is not individually wrapped, therefore you must put them in a tight container to prevent leakage of flavor or drink all 20 bags quickly.As to the tea, it's advertised mainly as Bavarian wild berry flavor, and there is a lot of that, but actually you can taste a lot of hips flavor as well.

However, when I opened the inner box, I was immediately disappointed.  The basket looked nothing like the main picture on Amazon.  All SIX (6) sample-sized gluten free treats were packaged flatly inside the crocodile leather-LOOKING cardboard basket.  NOTE: If you click on 'other views' there is a picture of how the basket actually appears upon arrival.The basket contained (SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION):Almond CrunchBlack Truffle + White Cheddar PopcornGarden Select Vegetable ChipsGinger SnapsSea Salt and Cracked Pepper Kettle ChipsValdosta PecansI found the overall dimensions to be only 11.5L x 7.5D x 4.5H at the WIDEST points.  The basket is still moderately attractive, but not nearly as attractive as pictured.I had ordered the basket as a birthday gift for a dear friend with Celiac Disease.  She was very touched I had found a basket of treats which were specifically suitable for her condition.  However, as she opened the basket, I was somewhat embarrassed at how little each package contained.  Each product realistically offered nothing more than a generous handful of the snack.I would estimate the retail value of each of the six snacks included to be between $1 and $2.  As stated, the basket itself is nothing more than embossed cardboard of low-end dollar store quality.  The ribbon, shrink wrap and shredded paper filler might add another dollar or two to the cost.  And, of course, we have to take into consideration that as a ""free shipping"" item through Amazon, the shipping cost is most likely around $10.  With shipping making up nearly half of the cost, I estimate the value of the basket to be roughly $25 SHIPPED.  I believe the basket and contents itself to be worth more like $15.At $34.99, I do NOT believe the basket is a good value.  If you look carefully, you will note beside the price it states ($26.92/lb).  You should use that notation as your 'value indicator.'In conclusion, the basket DOES make an impression as a THOUGHTFUL gift for someone who has a special condition.

Here's my take on it:I'm not a habitue of Taco Bell, preferring to make my food from scratch, so my expectations weren't high for this sauce, especially after trying the orange-y chipotle sauce. That said, I didn't find it as objectionable as many reviewers. It is creamy, in a processed way, and there's definitely a bit of a jalapeno bite, though not strong.I tried it on a few seasoned Doritos and felt the chip seasoning overwhelmed the sauce, which is quite mild. I compared it with the chipotle sauce and feel it is the better tasting of the two. That said, it isn't a sauce I'd put on a taco. I use my home made chipotle crema or a spicy salsa or pico de gallo. It might be good on a wrap in place of mayonnaise and would certainly spice up chopped lettuce. My rating: a 3.5, partly because the sodium is high at 310 and the calories are high as well.",4,Bold and creamy might be a misnomer,1318032000

28481,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B0009F3SAK,Sneaky Burrito,"I am drinking this right now and am kind of undecided how I feel about it.  The licorice flavor is strong, and it's not a flavor I'm normally fond of when I find it in tea.  But it's not as bad here as in other teas I've had.  I can taste a hint of spice (clove, cardamom, cinnamon) and that may be improving the flavor for me.  I'm not familiar with all of the other ingredients, but I don't notice any odd or unrecognizable flavors, so I guess the overall blend works well (if you can stand the licorice).The licorice root likely does have some effect on the liver.  Please see the comments below for a link to a web page from the National Institutes of Health regarding the safety of licorice.  Probably in small amounts and/or for only a few weeks at a time, this ingredient will not cause problems.  However, if you have hypertension or are pregnant, you will want to avoid this tea.  It also may interfere with the action of some prescription drugs (many of which are processed by the liver).My main criticism is that there isn't any documented medical or scientific need to do any kind of detox.  Please see the comments below for a link from the Mayo Clinic about detox diets.  Your liver and kidneys are already optimized for removing dangerous substances from the body and if you think your liver or kidneys are not functioning optimally, it's probably best to consult a medical doctor.  Additionally, because this is a tea, the amounts of the active ingredients may vary from cup to cup, depending on the temperature of the water, how many bags you brew at once, and how long you steep the tea.  So you may be getting different amounts of the ingredients at different times.In the end, whether or not to consume this tea is up to you.  If this is something you're interested in, I encourage you to investigate the ingredients further.  Personally, I don't believe detox is necessary and will probably not drink this tea frequently, for that reason.  Also, I am not a fan of licorice in tea, although, as I said earlier, this is one of the more tolerable licorice-containing teas I've tried.  2.5 stars.",3,mixed feelings about this one,1401840000

I take a bite and the first thing I notice is the nutty flavor, with a hint of blueberry aftertaste.  The bar itself is soft and ever so slightly sticky, but not sticky enough to be messy.  This bar is very densely packed material.  Not crumbly or flakey.I appreciate the fact that this is all organic and very healthy and that nothing is cooked and processed.  But I wonder how they deal with e-coli and the like.  E-Coli is found on plants and in animals.  The bar clearly states that it isn't processed or cooked.  I know there have been E-Coli scares with raw juices and spinach and other produce so I do wonder how they try and prevent it in their product.The flavor has a weird sweetness to it.  Maybe that is the nature of unprocessed food!  I don't eat a lot of organic food and the only raw food I eat is plain fruits and veggies.  When I bake I tend to pile on the sugar or honey in some cases for sweetness, so that is the flavor I am accustomed to.So for me this bar is not a good match, if I were to buy a fruit bar (which I don't do often) I'd probably stick to good ol' Nutragrain which has a flavor somehow more familiar.

And if you want 15 grams of protein in your drink (and I do, when I'm working hard,) you're going to have to taste it.When I review something I list the negatives first, then move on to the positives.  I'm stuck here.  I can't find anything negative to say.  This drink has no saturated fats, no trans fats, and no corn syrup.  It does have iron, which is not something you want to add to your diet if you don't need it, but it's only got 10% of the recommended daily value.  It's only got 125 MG of sodium.  I can't even complain about the flavor.  So I'll have to skip the ""complaints"" section.The ingredient list includes extra light olive oil.  I'm not sure why that's necessary.  It could be for the texture, which is thick and smooth.  If so, olive oil was a good choice, because the texture is good and there's only 2.5 grams of unsaturated fat in one bottle.These are the things that I like about it:* 15 grams of whey protein* 29 grams of carbs, 22 grams of which are organic cane sugar* The carbs provide fast energy when I need it, the protein keeps my blood sugar stable over time.* 200 calories, just right for a hard workout, and only 20 fat calories* The ingredient list is refreshingly short, with no gums or hydrogenated oils or items I can't pronounce.* It's got 23 vitamins and minerals, which are all in my diet when I eat properly... something I plan to do sometime next week.I'm not sure on this--would someone who is vegan help me out?  It seems to be vegetarian and vegan friendly, though I can't vouch for the list of vitamins and minerals.I've got a box of protein bars that I can't stand, because they taste chalky and they've melted in my pantry.

This is because Whole Foods tends to deal in organic and sustainable foods. You pay a little more, but you're paying for quality and peace of mind that say, there aren't more dolphins than tuna in your can of preserved wadden fish meat.Here's a breakdown on what you get in this $50 box1) 6 oz box of Dancing Deer Lemon Daisy Cookies. These have a very strong lemon fragrance to them, but not too strong of a lemon taste. My girlfriend is generally anti-lemon, and even she liked these.2) 6 oz Vermont Smoke and Cure Uncured Summer Sausage. This was incredible. I really loved the slightly smokey flavour and it was great by itself or accompanied by the mustard and cheeses in this gift basket.3) 8 oz Grafton Village Vermont Raw Milk Cheddar Cheese. I love raw milk cheeses and this was no exception. I've never had raw milk on its own but I know it's a hotely debated topic. The cheeses however are controversy free and thankfully too, as they are quite tasty.4) 6 oz bag Pretzel Crisps Supreme. As I was born and raised in Philadelphia, I'm a pretzel-aholic. I love Pretzel Crisps and buy them from my local Harris Teeter regularly, so I was happy to see these in here. Same great pretzel taste, but the wafer like thin nature make them low calorie. Win-win here!5) 2 oz bag Sahale Cashews w/ Pomegranate & Vanilla. This was a great combination. You have the salty in the nuts and the sweet with the vanilla. Add in the tart from the pomegrante and this snack mix is wonderful.6) 2 oz bag Sahale Soledad Almonds w/ Apple, Flax Seeds, Date, Balsamic Vinegar & Red Pepper. Another great snack mix here. The flavors all combine wonderfully with the highlight being how the red pepper compliments everything. Very tasty. This was easily my favorite thing in the entire package.7) 3.5 oz Sweet Riot 60% Dark Chocolate Bar w/ Crunchy Cacao Nibs. This is the weakest part of the gift basket. It's good, but it's like any other premium dark chocolate bar out there.8) 125 ml jar AJ's Walla Walla Sweet Onion Mustard. This is really good. I love different mustards. While this is no Sono Trading Company Champagne Garlic or Hong Kong Habanero, it's still a delicious sweet mustard that compliments the cheese and sausage in the gift basket.All in all this is an incredible basket that will make a wonderfully gift for friends who are no longer near a Whole Foods, foodies, or people who you are simply stumped on what to get them for the holidays.

Nice portion size, especially because you'll want more than one portion. Attractive on a plate, unlike traditional tortilla chips. Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy.

There are a variety of brands on the market, and some are better than others. Being the type of person that I am, I always like trying new products to see how they compare to my current products, so I gladly agreed to try the Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil when offered a sample to review.When it comes to coconut oil, there are some that smell and taste like coconut oil (some more than others), and then there are others that don't have the coconut smell/taste. I personally prefer the ones that smell/taste like coconut, but I do keep some coconut oil on hand that doesn't have the taste for cooking purposes when I don't want delicate foods to have any coconut flavor. When I opened up the Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil jar, the lovely coconut smell made me smile. I had to taste it to see if the taste could compare to the aroma. I was pleased to see that it had that light coconut flavor that just melts on your tongue.Like other coconut oil, it is solid at room temperatures below 76 degrees F. Unlike many oils, coconut oil is shelf stable and does not easily go rancid. It's actually quite good for you taken internally or used externally. This particular coconut oil is cold-pressed and unrefined.Since I don't mind smelling a bit like the tropics, I used it on some wounds to help them heal quicker. I also use it lightly as a skin moisturizer at night. When I'm baking and grease the pan, I just rub the extra oil into my skin instead of washing it off.Overall, I'm impressed with the quality of the Viva Labs Organic Coconut Oil and would have no issue purchasing it in the future.

But I was too busy pigging out on these delicious snacks and sharing them with two eager dogs to notice any smell.The snacks are cheesy, crunchy, and very tasty. Some will care that these are gluten free, and natural, and made in the USA with non GMO ingredients. My one and only criterion is taste, and these pass muster easily. They do have a resemblance to the taste of cheese macaroni and even to the look. If you're careful not to get cheese in your eye, you can even look right through the middle of many of these.After eating most of a bag with my two canine girls, there was plenty of snack residue on my fingers that needed to be washed off.

By itself it probably wouldn't have done for two, not by itself, but I wouldn't've needed to add too much more.  For four this packet might make a decent side dish.The point is, there's enough in the packet to allow you to play with portions.It's a breeze to cook, took me just over ten minutes from start to finish, and that's including time to fry the egg.  It would have been very easy to clean up after had I not allowed the sauce pan of milk and water to boil over.  Mea culpa.  The instructions called for a quarter cup of milk and 1 3/4 cups of water, plus a tablespoon of margarine; I added a little more milk and a little less water to make the thing a little thicker.  Even then it was a hair on the soupy side.  If I make it again I may add a little less liquid altogether.Taste, of course, is the main concern.  It tastes pretty good; nothing to write home about, but as I said in the title, satisfying.  The chipotle has quite a kick; after a few bites I decided to add a dash of sugar to cut the spiciness a bit, and I do believe that improved things considerably.  Unless you really love spiciness, even more than me--and I do enjoy my spices--you might consider doing the same.This was a quick to make and, with a little egg or chicken or whatever added in, can provide a very satisfying dinner.

Munck,"I ran across a smaller box of these in an HEB store in Austin, TX and decided to give it a try since San Francisco is known for its excellent coffee. &#34;Horrendous&#34; is the only word to describe what I ended up with! Even though the plastic bag containing the cups was sealed the coffee tasted like it had been sitting in the open air for months and was totally stale. So stale, in fact, that I would rate it as probably the worst coffee I have ever drunk. Had the coffee been fresh I may have been able to overlook the powdery coffee residue in my cup as a result of the bag's construction, but as it was that just added one more reason to gripe. Let me be clear that this review is not about bashing coffee from San Francisco. I have had some great coffee from there. My bad review is based on a single box of these K-cups. Others, based on their good reviews, have obviously not gotten a box of stale coffee like I did and were able to enjoy their purchase. I used three of the cups and the rest went into a garbage bag. This brings me to the reason I may not ever give this coffee a second chance: The packaging. The cups are not individually sealed in plastic, but instead have a filter bag that allows air to get to the coffee. The cups were sealed within an outer bag and should have been fresh when first opened, but they weren't; and even if they had been they wouldn't have stayed that way for long due to the poor cup design that exposes the ground coffee to the staling effects of air. Worried about landfills? Well, you either throw plastic K-cups away or else you throw these partially plastic cups away along with a large outer bag made of plastic. For me the decision is a much simpler one: fresh coffee or stale coffee...and fresh coffee wins every time.",1,Based on other good reviews I may give it a 2nd chance.....or maybe not,1403222400

I'm guessing this is due by the shipping method Amazon used on the Vine items as opposed to customer purchased goods shipped via UPS.The box had the 10 nut bars in it each one with the same expiration date which in this case was approx 4 months from today, plenty of time to eat the items without them going bad. I will say that I love to eat almonds and honey roasted peanuts so I was excited to get this product. Its called the ""Triple Nut"" and contains honey roasted peanturs, almonds and cashews and they do not skimp on any of them. The bar is totally loaded with nuts, however there is a little filler which I imagine is used to glue it all together and get the bar shape.Overall the bars are really good to me and I will definitly be purchasing these down the road. The only thing I don't like about the bars is the amount of ingredients listed but overall the ingredits are ones I am familiar with, they include:-peanuts-corn syrup-crisped rice-sugar-evaporated cane juice invert syrup-whole grain rolled oats-almonds-cashews-less then 1.5% whey-soy lecithin-salt-honey-vegetable oil-resistant corn dextrin-granola-xanthan gum-mixsed tocopherols (to protect flavors)So the list of ingredients isn't that overally concerning.

Charles Steiner,"This review is from: Kinnikinnick S'moreables Graham Style Crackers -- 8 ozThese delicious and gluten-free crackers are boxed with a Kosher Mafia symbol on the front, known as &#34;U&#34; with a circle around it. This means some of the cost of the product goes involuntarily from your hands into the rabbis' pocket -- without giving you one lick of goodness for the tax you involuntary pay in return. Knowing that these crackers are kosher isn't helpful since anyone can read the ingredients for himself or herself and find out how well made and healthy they are. No buddinski needs to give his opinion about these ingredients and then demand to receive payment for that unnecessary opinion.These scrumptious crackers, however, are addictive, like an earlier Amazon reviewer has stated, though they do contain soy lecithin and may contain egg as well. I've seen teething babies eat crackers like these, and I'm glad as an adult I can receive the same joy as those teething infants.

One downside is that they kind of clumped together after I drained the water and when I tried to separate them using a fork, a few fell apart.

(Unfortunately, I dumped about a half of a bag by accident on my husband when I first opened them up and asked him to smell them!  D'oh!  Good thing they vacuum up easily! ;-) )They look like cooked quinoa, but have a very different taste that is very unique; it's a nutty taste that stands out if you add them on top of another food, but that falls to the background if you use them in smoothies.  The taste reminds me of a mix of pine nuts and sunflower seeds.Hempseeds contain all ten amino acids, so they're a complete protein if you're vegan or vegetarian -- or just looking for alternative protein sources.  Three tablespoons of this Nutiva brand contain 10 grams of protein.They also have a good mix of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids.  From what I have read, the World Health Organization has stated that the ideal ratio of Omega-6's to Omega-3's is 4:1, and hempseeds have a ratio of 3.75:1, which is excellent.Additionally, hempseeds contain chlorophyll, Vitamins B and E, and folic acid.Here are some ways I've been using them:*  added to smoothies*  on top of yogurt*  mixed in with my oatmeal*  sprinkled on top of salads*  added into quinoa and bean or rice dishesThey've been an interesting addition to my diet so far, and I'm glad I tried them out!",5,"A complete protein with a nutty, delicious taste",1374105600

It's definitely not the same - there's a non-coffee taste to this coffee, but there is no relation to that taste and the hazelnut that I've tasted with the other two brands.

If this was my first San Francisco Bay coffee, I wouldn't be back. I guess that I'll limit myself to the Breakfast Blend at San Francisco Bay, and then to the Gloria Jean's for hazelnut.I posted the above review on my first purchase, where the product was unremarkable. today, April 2, 2013, I purchased a second box, and the results are much better.

The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas, but does not taste right in green tea. Other then the licorice it does have a very good lemon flavor that is soothing and mild. The Kombucha tea is also great which has a berry taste, that is good and natural passion fruit and plum, but I prefer the lemon flavor in my green tea. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor in it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you? At first I just bought these teas for the messages then I learned to love the tea as well! Rejuvenation is my favorite green tea and Peach Detox and Redbush Chai are my favorite flavored teas and make exceptionally good iced tea as well! The flavors, however, are very close and it took me quite a while to figure out which green tea I preferred the best. This one is good if you like licorice in your green tea that is.Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan""The universe is the stage on which you dance, guided by your heart.""""The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment.""""Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace.""""Laugh because that is your purpose in life.""Happiness is every human beings birthright.""""Be happy so long as breath is in you.""""Real happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes, but simply is.""""Travel light, live light, spread the light, be the light.""""Your greatness is not what you have, it's what you give.""""Practice kindness, mercy and forgiveness.""""Bliss cannot be disturbed by gain or loss.""""Compassion has no limit.

Because I like my mug coffee REALLY sweet, it's more convenient for me to have the .5 oz strenth concentration handy. I use 4 to 5 drops per mug, depending on how strong the brew/roast is and which mug I use. VERY SWEET.However, I also buy the less concentrated type for when I want to be able to more finely control the sweetness level and I buy it for my relatives. The guys in the family don't need the supersweet drop for their espresso. So, they get the more diluted version. Easier to control sweetness level.I say all this because THIS IS THE DILUTED VERSION in a smaller size (and different bottle type). If you don't mind using more drops per cup or recipe or whatever, then no problem. Just know this is not as concentrated as some other EZ SWEETZ sizesIf you normally get the 2 oz 800 serving size--the longer bottle with the yellow cap-- then know this is the same concentration, but the bottle is smaller and it's half the servings per bottle. That means the price is the same per serving: 800 servings for 12.99. The size may be more convenient for you to carry around is all. Some folks want a handier bottle for purses, for example.If you use and enjoy the blue-capped/more concentrated version, this will disappoint.I use both concentrations at home. I take a superconcentrated one in my purse to save space.But this is a very convenient (if not necessarily healthful) product. It's got additives and there is concern for how this affects the intestinal flora. But unsweetened iced tea and coffee have no allure for me, and I used to be prediabetic. I can't indulge in sugar or lots of honey. So, I compromise with sucralose. And this has been my favorite Sucralose product. (Yes, I tried Sweetzfree without the additives and it was a disaster from the way it came out of the bottle--unmanageable--to how it clotted/clogged up the hole for dispensing. If they fixed those issues, I'd rebuy.)  I stick mostly to sucralose cause I don't trust Equal or Sweet n Low, and can't stand the taste of Stevia.

But they pack a very intense peanut butter flavor so a little goes a long way.  Which is good, as a little is all you can have if you adhere to the recommended portion size. One way to make sure you don't accidentally eat more than you're supposed to, is to portion out the servings into small little ziplock bags or wrap them up in cellophane then twist tie them off and store in a large ziplock bag to keep them fresh. I suggest doing that for just about everything you eat. It's what I do to keep track of the calories these days. And at least that way if you do eat more, you can't claim ignorance about how much you actually ate. It does help keep you honest.Would have given this 5 stars, but I didn't really appreciate the fact that these cookies were not shipped in a box. They come in a bag, and Amazon shipped them in a bag, so there was no real protection for the delicate cookies and so there was some amount of breakage and crumbling of the contents. With such a small bag to start with, and at $6 a bag, losing any amount like that is unacceptable.Edit; I just want to add since purchasing these crackers from Amazon I've found a site called ""netrition.com and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food.I bought these crackers from netrition for only 2.99 per bag. and unlike Amazon they DID ship them in a box! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix.

It's strong and you can smell it beforehand, but in the end if you're a very picky consumer that goes only based on the taste of the coffee, you might end up passing this one over.What really impressed me about this is that the entire packaging can be recycled. It might seem wasteful at first glance, as the K-cup filter is contained in a plastic wrapper. The reason behind this is that regular K-cups have a plastic lining that keeps them from melting but also makes it pretty much impossible to recycle through any of the conventional means. (Recycling bins and whatnot.) The plastic wrapper was added to this because that way the coffee can be kept fresh and the K-cup itself can be made out of recyclable materials without having to worry about adding this plastic liner. You do have to cut open the container at the end and remove the coffee, but that's a small issue if you're worried about whether or not your K-cup is recyclable... and you should be worried. People are using so many K-cups that there's a new and pressing need to find a way to make K-cups recyclable. This isn't perfect, but it's an excellent start.However I know that many of you will wonder why you should choose this over the ""My K-cup"" stuff out there that allows you to create your own K-cup from whatever coffee you choose. The simple fact is that not all Keurig machines allow you to install the reusable filters. My work has two machines, one that will allow you to use the reusable filters of any variety and one that cannot. This type of K-cup is good for when you are going places and either can't bring your reusable K-cup with you or the machine won't allow you to use it. Again, this isn't a perfect alternative but at least it is an alternative that's better than using a K-cup that can't be recycled and will be around for years to come.There are other options out there than this, such as the semi-reusable/refillable K-cups that you can use up to a certain amount of times, but this is another good option out for those who want something other than the un-recyclable K-cups.

Because these are individual packets, it is easy to keep a few in a gym bag, work desk or purse. I think the flavor is decent.  The lemonade flavor, in my opinion, is not as good as Wyler's pink lemonade or iced tea with peach.  I purchase Wyler's lemonade at my local grocery store for about 10 cents a packet.Some individuals may be concerned to know that this product has aspartame and acesulfame potassium. A lot of diet beverages, including powdered beverage sticks, use these additives. Both have been linked to cancer in rats and both were deemed one of the top ten worst additives by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. So, if you are cautious about additives in your food, this product may not be for you. A serving for this product is 1/2 of a packet and 1/2 of a packet has 5 calories and 20% of your daily vitamin C. To make a full, sufficiently flavored 16 ounce glass, you really do need the entire packet.For proper dissolution of the powder, it is best to follow the recommendation on the box and place the powder into something that can be shaken.  Some companies make products that dissolve pretty well when stirred with a spoon or straw.  This product is not one of them.If you are seeking an alternative product that does not utilize these controversial ingredients and has more vitamins, I would recommend the powered beverages that are made by NOW Foods, includingAcai Lemonade Sugar Free Drink Sticks 1.7 oz sticks 12 SticksandSugar Free Drink Sticks Pomegranate Berry 12 pckts.

You squirt the cleaner (which is this liquid white stuff that sort of reminds me of watery car waxer a little bit), rub it around and then wipe clean with paper towels. Sometimes I'd have to use a utility blade (sort of like a very sturdy kind of razor blade thing in a plastic holder) to scrape some of the more stubborn cooked on gunk off.I didn't mind the Weimans cleaner. I liked it better than anything else I'd tried but after trying the Scotch-Brite cleaner, I much prefer it instead. I don't have to wear gloves while using it and it seems like it requires less ""elbow grease"" than the Weimans cleaner.It's simple to use - just remove a pad from the resealable pack, apply it to the handle that comes with it and you're ready to go. Also, there's no overpowering unpleasant odor and I found though it's attached to a flat surface on the handle, you can still easily get into the edges around the perimeter of the stove top. I still have to use the utility blade but it seemed like the gunk came off with less scraping and pressure.Regarding cost: In the kit I got there was the handle and 3 packs of pads with 6 pads per pack for a total of 18 pads. I found unless I had an boil over accident, I could re-use every pad at least once so the kit would last me at least a month and possibly 6 weeks depending on how messy I've been so to me the cost was worth it for something that's so easy to use and works so well with the added bonus that it's faster than using the Weiman cleaner.I will definitely be using more of this in the future.Thank you to the Vendor/Manufacturer and Amazon for giving me the opportunity to give this a try.",5,LOVE It!

I received my free sample in the mail on a hot, hot, day and so I don't know if that may have somehow altered the taste but I did wait to taste it only after it had been chilled in the fridge for several hours.My initial reaction to the taste was neither good or bad, just that it wasn't at all what I had expected an all natural apple flavored drink to taste like.  It tastes an awful lot like sour apple blow pops (the candy), in liquid form.  Not necessarily a bad taste for candy but as a beverage, not so good.  As I continued to sip away at this drink, it became obvious that I wasn't going to be able to finish the can (I was about half ways through...).  There was an unpleasant taste to this drink that I can't quite put my finger on, but I noticed that it intensified each time I returned to take another sip.  Maybe something you wouldn't notice if you can swig the entire can down in a few gulps...  not sure why each subsequent tasting made it less and less palatable from the sip prior, maybe the Stevia sweetener?  I don't know.As for being an energy drink, one can is supposed to have the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee.  I already drink an absurd amount of coffee daily to begin with...  I didn't notice an energy boost from the half can I was able to drink and don't anticipate that I would have had I been able to drink the full can.  This might appeal to individuals who don't consume caffeine on a daily basis to begin with and would find other energy drinks to be a bit too stimulating.

I don't think any kid, ar adult with cravings, is going to be patient enough to spread this piece by piece on a slice of bread-- there will be alot of ripped bread slices and short tempers all over the kitchen. PB Crave Peanut Butter, Razzle Dazzle Premium has to be heated in order to partially melt it. This is not what I expect from Peanut Butter, unless I am making a Sundae Topping -- Peanut Butter is a food often used satisfy an immediate craving, and ""Immediate"" has no patience with waiting for the product to heat until it is malleable enough to spread on bread.  Also, the jar I received had a huge 1 inch air gap that went from the top to the bottom -- either from the contents settling while in transit (which I doubt, since the weather from the Vine warehouse to my East Coast home has been pretty cold) or because the factory is also having problems with the spreadability (and viscosity) of their product.HOWEVER, this IS a nice peanut butter. The taste is unusually good -- the combination of a burst  of red raspberry, wild honey, white chocolate and dark chocolate comes off quite well - this peanut butter bursts with flavor bites as you eat it. I dug into the jar (just once per spoon &lt;:-) and ate it with a spoon but since this product is so thiiiick, I didn't enjoy the usual joys of ""rolling the peanut butter on the tongue and in the mouth as a huge smile spreads across your face"" thing.I tried it on hot english muffins -- and it is STELLAR! It MEELTS very nicely and the various flavors really shine here. And melted, it is a great topping for ice cream. I would also suspect this PBCrave would make a DYNAMITE Peanut butter cookie!! I've eaten 3/4 of the jar so I would need to buy a new jar in order to test this hypothesis.Their website, pbcrave dot com has a nice picture of a PB and Banana parfait on its (new, not yet finished) recipes page. It also states that you can spread PB Crave on crackers. Maybe in the summer, and definitely if you heat it first. But not right out of the jar.PB Crave also donates a portion of its proceeds to Project Peanut Butter, whose ""goal is to help save the lives of 2 million children. A minimum of 2% of the profits from every jar of PB Crave peanut butter goes directly to Project Peanut Butter, a non-profit organization focused on treating malnourished children.""PB Crave also has a committment to high standards of manufacturing and quality.

In short, I'd only recommend these dried apples in situations where fresh apples are impractical (hiking, say).One quibble: In the bag I tried, there were a couple of pieces of apple peel that, through the drying process, had become too hard to chew, almost like fingernail clippings.

I love almost all kinds of teas and in my condo in San Diego I have two shelves filled with different flavors. NONE has been Earl Grey and the reason is that over the years I tried Earl Grey and there was eiither a slight sharpness to the flavor, or else they were in tea bags and no matter how prestigious the name the tea tasted cheap, almost sprayed with flavor rather than blended. So NO JOKE I never had a full box of Earl Grey. Until NOW and I tried Lipton's black tea Earl Grey. This is the best Earl Grey I've had and it will be in on my tea shelf forever. They have smoothed the flavor of Earl Grey, and also enhanced it so it's the best, most delicious and satisfying cup of Earl Grey ever -- and I would say one of the best teas I've had. The front of the box says it's &#34;Earl Grey with Bergamont flavor and other natural flavor.&#34; The back of the box says it has Orange Pekoe and Pekoe Cut Black Tea, Marigold Flowers, and natural flavors. Plus, it uses a pyramid teabag. There is a school of thought that a pyramid tea bag gives a fuller, more flavorful tea, since it's closer to loose tea. I will say: WHATEVER.

I was a bit worried that the raspberry flavor was going to taste odd, but to my surprise it actually made the nuggets that more tasty.The heat level of the chipotle is fairly mild to my standards, though the more you eat it the hotter it feels.And finally the ingredients, NO CORN SYRUP! To my surprise they didn't cheap out and use corn syrup as the sweetener, just good ol sugar.F & W's Razzpotle sauce is definitely gourmet, even though it tastes good on almost everything you put it on (including chicken nuggets).Pros:Really tastes like raspberries.Some good heat from the jalapenos and chipotle peppers that are in it.Nice and smokey.Not made with corn syrup!Cons:Spendy (go figure).Very seedy, some people might not like the amount of raspberry seeds in the sauce.",5,"The ""ORIGINAL"" IS the best!",1232409600

They consisted of ""Ring Shaped Pasta and Cheese"" , ""Three-Cheese Couscous"", and ""Long-Grain Rice Pilaf"". We prepared them all in one night to taste and compare and no one in my family of four came away impressed. In general what we noticed is that all of them have alot of sodium (~20-30%) and fat.Specifically about the pasta: the taste was perfectly ordinary. I can buy 2 packs of similar sized mac and cheese for a $1 in stores around here and it will taste the same... and i'm pretty sure those wont give me 65% of my daily Sat fat value or 32% sodium. I was really surprised about the sat fat value in fact, 65% is probably the highest i've seen listed in the nutritional facts of any product i've bought.Specifically about the couscous: worst of the 3 products we tried.It had pretty much no real flavor... a completely bland side dish. They say its ""3-cheese"" but maybe they should try to get just 1 working first because i couldnt taste any cheese whatsoever.Specifically about the rice pilaf: best dish of the 3. It actually had some flavor to it; not much mind you but much better that the other 2. If you add some extra spices or some such it can turn out to be a pretty good side dish.Overall i say stay away from these sidemates side dishes products.

What Adding Salt May Do To Baby's Health?After your body has taken what it needs from the food, waste is sent to the blood. If your kidneys did not remove these wastes, the wastes would build up in the blood and damage your body.

The ""Pure Organic Wild Blueberry"" bar isn't a total miss, but it doesn't exactly hit a home run either.There is a significant amount of fat and sugar in the bar, but it's all coming from fruit sugar and raw nuts, which automatically makes it a better choice than anything that has high fructose corn syrup as the first ingredient.  The bar also has small amounts of calcium and vitamin C, but significantly less of the vitamins and minerals typically found in health bars.  On the upside, absolutely everything is organic and nothing is cooked, so it has a huge appeal to anyone who prefers non-processed foods.As far as the taste is concerned it's definitely not a candy bar or any other snack with loads of extra sugar.  It has a very mild blueberry flavor, which is pleasant, but not outstanding.  The texture is a winner however, as its incredibly chewy and moist.  Overall it seems like the flavor should be better for something that's so packed with fruits and nuts. Aside from the flavor and nutrition aspects, the Pure bar does have another draw for environmentally conscious consumers.  Pure runs a campaign where they plant a tree for every three wrappers sent in to their headquarters, which may make them worth buying even if the flavor isn't amazing.While the blueberry taste is toned down and the bar doesn't offer as much extra nutritional value as the standard health food bar, it's still worth a try for anyone who wants to see if they dig the texture or just wants to support an environmentally friendly product.",3,"Not a home run, but worth a try if you like organic and non-processed snacks",1272499200

Not only can the K-Cups be expensive, they can also be limited in terms of what kinds of coffee are available or whether you enjoy the types that are available.Melitta E-Filter Reusable K-Cups  offer you the flexibility of using your own coffee, ground fresh the way you like it.  Also, by adding more or less coffee to the Melitta reusable K-Cup, you can control the strength of the brew to some extent.Filling the Melitta K-Cups can get a bit messy.  I like my coffee strong, so not only do I try to fill the Melitta K-Cups but I try to tamp down the coffee to fit in as much as possible.  This invariably creates a mess.  I find that a medium to fine grind works just as well as the off-the-shelf K-Cups.  I don't see coffee grounds in my cup like some have said.The strength of the brew really comes down to how much time the water is in contact with the coffee as well as other factors like how fine the grind.  Unfortunately, water flowing through a K-Cup is quickly going to find the path of least resistance and you can only get so much strength out of a single K-Cup no matter how tightly you pack in the coffee.That said, I'm pleased with the quality of the coffee coming from using these reusable K-Cups.  I've used the same filter 25 times now and it is a bit stained but appears to be OK.  Even though I do like these, I find myself gravitating to the convenience of the pre-measured K-Cups and I like having the variety of using different brands each day.

The ""to go"" packages are all over the place now and if you've been in a convenience store recently, you'll find them right near the water.  Most of these I'll shy away from because of the high acid content.  I do like them, but it's simply trading one problem for another.I can taste the honey in these drinks, but not the tea.  Honey granules are a very popular sweetener, but so is Splenda.  In essence the reason these drinks are so sweet is because of the sucralose which is marketed under several names.  If you have problems with this, you can simply take a pass.  All of the information is not hidden, but here on the pictures for everyone to take a look at.Personally, I do love the taste of these ""teas,"" which taste more like fruit drinks than they do tea.  The real tea drinker in my house actually liked the taste, but does prefer his real tea with his cookies.  If you like the ""to go"" factor and like your teas ultra-sweet, you may just like these teas.

There was alot of plastic and cardboard waste after the meal. If you look at the ingredient list, this is not a healthy meal, it's just a convenient packaging alternative for $4.00+.  This is loaded with preservatives and sugar.There was a turkey beef stick that was quite tasty but difficult to open, if it had been a child on a picnic they would have had to get adult help and teeth.  There was applesauce that was OK, nothing special.  The cheese was processed and just one ounce.  Any kid over 12 years old would eat 5 of them. There were snapea crisps that my son was hesitant to eat because of their appearance but he did and did like them.  But if you have a picky eater I doubt you're going to get them to try them.  The sunflower crunch and gummy bears were the favorites, duh. And it came with a collapsable spork. If they had designed the applesauce to be in a tube (like gogurt) then there would be no need for a spork and could have eliminated 2 pieces of plastic waste (the spork and the plastic wrap it came in).  The meal also comes with a wet-nap and a lick-n-stick tattoo.  Overall not enough food for a kid over 9 and a child under 9 wouldn't be able to get the stuff open.And lots of landfill waste.  If it had come with a juice pouch it would have at least been an all in one meal.  And at $4.00+ it's a little expensive for what you get, considering you still have to buy a drink.

22179,A1FPQ54AIB26L0,B007JFMIWW,Mike Wallace,"I thought the strawberry filling in these bars tasted pretty good. It was a lot like the filling of a strawberry pop-tart, just a little more of it. The crust is an unsweetened oat crust, and that is what it tastes like. After reading other reviews I expected to bite into these and for it to just crumble into a pile of crumbs, but that doesn't happen. The outside crust is crunchy and will create crumbs, but not as many as some reviewers stated.I like the thought of no trans-fats although, technically it says zero grams of trans-fats, so it could still have small amounts of trans-fat. The rest of the ingredients are highly processed, so as far as health goes, it is what it is. As far as taste goes, the filling is sweet and the crust is not, I think this bar would be tastier if the crust had a little more sweetness in it, but the plan was probably for the unsweetened ""cookie"" crust to offset the sweet filling.If you are expecting this to be like other soft, fruit filled bars you will be disappointed. If you like crunchy crusts offset with a sweet filling, and health isn't a concern then you would like these. I also don't understand the Stila name, maybe there is a marketing plan for that name.

Many whole grain and gluten-free pastas (and believe me when I say I've tried a bunch) leave something to be desired in the taste/texture department.  These Tinkyada brown rice elbows are wonderful, however.Someone in my office is allergic to gluten.  We recently had a potluck lunch at work.  Since I am a vegetarian, I know what it is like to be unable to eat a good portion of the food available at such events.  In the spirit of inclusiveness, I decided that I would bring GF macaroni and cheese, and this was the pasta I chose.  People in my office have commented negatively on GF pasta before, so I didn't tell them the macaroni was gluten free.  And not a single person noticed!  (I said something to the GF person in advance.)  I did receive comments on other ingredients (e.g. real Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese), and there weren't any leftovers.  I consider that a smashing success.  (The color is slightly darker than regular pasta, but not by a lot, and if it is coated with cheese sauce, it can be hard to see the color.)Also, this pasta holds up well to long cooking times -- it says so on the bag, but I had occasion to test this out.  Because the aforementioned macaroni was made in a slow cooker, it was going to be heated for much longer than the recommendation on the package.  Even so, it had the perfect texture when it was time to eat.  I would expect this pasta to perform similarly well in baked pasta dishes.  (Pre-cook it, but go for slightly less than the time recommended on the package, for best results.)I have not had any trouble with leftovers.  I did a trial run of my slow cooker macaroni and cheese recipe (don't want to take something untested to work and have it be a miserable failure, after all) and it made way too much for me to eat in one sitting.  I portioned the leftovers out -- froze some and refrigerated some -- and found them to have an acceptable texture afterwards.

I really like the taste - this milk is slightly creamier than regular milk and my kids love it because to them it is like a ""milkshake"".What I really love is the fact that it is organic and hormone free - something I am paying more attention to lately and looking for when buying dairy and meat products. Organic Valley is a company that cares about it's farmers, animals and it's consumers.  Their products do not contain pesticides, non-natural fertilizers, synthetic growth or breeding hormones, antibiotics or GMO's (genetically modified organisms). They care about their animals and the land that they graze.  When you purchase their products, you can feel good about what you are serving your family and you are supporting farmers who care as well.Amazon.com sells this product at a great price (lower than at my local natural food stores and even large chain stores).  I save even more by ordering this through Subscribe and Save - I save an additional 15% AND have the milk delivered to my door every month (you can have it delivered every 1,2,3,or 6 months and if you run out and need more you can have it sent on demand!)

38135,A1SB9BNNGKNX2Z,B004MO6NI8,Jim,"Some of the negative comments by other reviewers about the taste of No Fear Super Energy Supplement led me to expect the worst from the 16 ounce sample I received for review purposes, but to my surprise I liked the taste. I really liked it. I drank the entire can in place of my afternoon cup of coffee one day (which would've been 16 ounces made very strong with freshly ground Peet's French or Italian roast beans), and got a stronger, longer lasting buzz than the coffee would've given me, with no undesirable side effects (e.g., no jitters and no feeling that my heart was racing) or after effects (e.g., no ""crashing"").Each 16 ounce can of NFSES contains 2 servings, so one can contains 174 milligrams of caffeine. According to the Mayo Clinic, 16 ounces of Starbucks Pike Place brewed coffee contains 330 milligrams of caffeine, nearly twice the amount of caffeine in 16 ounces of NFSES.One thing that brewed coffee does not contain that NFSES and many other energy drinks contain is taurine. A 16 ounce can of NFSES contains 2000 milligrams of taurine, which is approximately the same amount of taurine found in 16 ounces of Red Bull.Taurine is an amino acid that was first isolated from ox bile in 1827, and the name taurine comes from the Latin word ""taurus"" (as in the astrological sign) for bull or ox. (The taurine in energy drinks is synthetic.) I recently purchased a bottle ofNow Foods Taurine 1000Mg, 100-Capsules. According to NOW Foods, taurine ""supports a calm mood"" or has a ""relaxing effect on the mood"" (statements that come with the disclaimer that the FDA has not evaluated these statements). And indeed that is my experience when I take one or two 1000 milligram taurine caps without drinking any caffeinated beverage. And so I am led to wonder why taurine is a major ingredient in so many energy drinks. Dr. Neil L. Harrison, who is a professor of pharmacology and anesthesiology at Columbia University says, ""Its inclusion in these supplements is a little puzzling, because our research would suggest ... [that] taurine actually would have more of a sedative effect on the brain."" (Source: Cornell University Chronicle Online, ""Scientists close in on taurine's activity in the brain"" 2/13/08.) (According to a 2004 article in Medical News Today titled, ""French ban on Red Bull (drink) upheld by European Court,"" Red Bull claims that taurine can kick-start the metabolism, which may thus be the reason it is included in so many energy drinks. The French ban Red Bull was lifted in 2008: ""The drink had been banned in France for twelve years due to health authorities' concerns about unknown consequences of the ingredient taurine, a chemical forbidden in several countries. Until now a modified version of the drink, containing caffeine but not taurine, was on sale in France."" Source: Reuters article, ""France ends 12-year ban on energy drink Red Bull,"" 7/15/08)Until now a modified version of the drink, containing caffeine but not taurine, was on sale in France.)A 16 ounce can of No Fear Super Energy Supplement has 260 calories, which is about the same number of calories found in two 12 ounce servings of beer (beer calories vary by brand), one MacDonald's hamburger (250 calories), or one 2 ounce Snicker's candy bar (266 calories). A 16 ounce can of Sugar Free Red Bull has 20 calories.I can't imagine that anyone would want to order a whole 12-pack of NFSES without first trying it to know if they find it palatable and to get a sense of how it affects them.",5,"Tastes good, effects comparable to Red Bull and Monster",1331164800

This water is perfect for those situations. The flavor is essentially tasteless. If your trying to taste it, It is slightly bitter. It's bitterness is so slight to my palate that I do not even notice it unless I'm trying to taste it. If i'm just driving to work or doing anything other than concentrating on my beverage I do not notice it at all. I actually like bitter flavors so for me it's actually pretty good. The slight bitterness leaves a crisp, clean sensation on my tongue. None of that morning coffee slime to deal with. The other benefit to this water is that it does not stain.

Having said that, it does sweeten decently: it isn't as pointedly sweet as most artificial sweeteners, but is not as strong as sugar, and it does have a hint of bitterness and leaves an aftertaste like some other substitutes.I like generally find stevia acceptable, and SweetLeaf advertises that they are the purest form of stevia on the market, but the taste and texture of Stevia in the Raw brand is superior to SweetLeaf. One big problem with SweetLeaf stevia is that it doesn't dissolve well in liquids, a problem I never encountered with Stevia in the Raw. I have yet to make a single cup of coffee or tea without getting clumps of sweetener forming (normally floating to the top of the liquid, though sometimes on the bottom of the cup.) This is apparently due to the extremely fine grain texture of SweetLeaf, but it is unappetizing at best. Another general issue is simple: this is an expensive product, far more expensive than most competing sweeteners and orders of magnitude more costly than bulk sugar.My bottom line is this: I find SweetLeaf stevia sweetener to be generally acceptable, if expensive, and will certainly finish the stock I have on hand. I think Stevia in the Raw has a better taste and texture, and certainly has better mixing and dissolution properties. Since I don't use much sweetener anyway, I generally bite the bullet and use sugar in my coffee or tea again: it's only got 16 calories per teaspoon, and I can find a way to work that into my daily dietary budget. If you like the taste and don't mind the expense and clumping issues, SweetLeaf stevia sweetener would be a good choice.",3,A Decent Natural Sweetener With Limitations,1395532800

It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated' and 'no preservatives', so I was expecting some sweet ~ this drink tastes like carbonated, watered-down orange juice, but it's actually a pretty good flavor, and packs 140 calories, 34g sugar and 36g carbs in a 'no sugar added'-'no corn syrup'- 'no preservatives'-'no artificial colors'-'gluten free' drink!  I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE a bit more natural, and this one, like I said above, tastes like carbonated orange juice with tangerine ~ it's nice tasting, but too much in the way of calories & such for me to drink this very often.It was certainly good, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda a year ago(I very occasionally drink a carbonated beverage now) this is not the drink for me.

27444,A3K8AU6BAGN60E,B004E4CCSQ,"Ms. Parrothead ""Book Lover""","Like many others, I am trying to give up sodas and drink more water.  In the past I have used the crystal light drink add-ins with mixed results, so when I saw this product I wanted to give it a try.  I like the concept of the liquid flavoring, that would eliminate the problem of the powders not dissolving all the way.  In addition, the bottle would allow the user to add as little or as much of the flavoring as he/she would like, for a customized beverage.With all of that in mind, I had high hopes for this product, and I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed once I actually used the product.  First, the bottle states to use ""two drops"" of flavoring for a 16 oz bottle of water.  I did use two drops, and aside from making a slight change in the color of the water, there was no change to the flavor of the water.  I took another bottle of water and added two ""squirts"" of flavoring to the water, and the results were more dramatic.  I must first add that fortunately for me, I did not experience the ""chemically"" or ""bleach"" smell that others seem to have experienced with this product.  What I did smell was the strong smell of ""artificial"" peach scent.  The scent immediately reminded me of a peach candle - that is to say very strong and artificial.  Despite the smell, I started to drink and while the flavor of the drink (while drinking it) wasn't too bad, it did leave an aftertaste in my mouth that I did not care for.  Also, bringing the bottle to my mouth caused my nose to be assaulted by the fake-peach smell again.  Try as I might, I was not able to finish that bottle.In order to provide an accurate appraisal of the product, I experimented more with the flavoring, slowly adding more drops (but less than the two squirts) until a more acceptable scent was acheived.  The first thing I determined is that there is no way to acheive as many bottles of flavored water as the package states.  Most people would have to use twice as much (at the minimum) to get any kind of flavor at all, which greatly reduces the amount of water you can flavor from one bottle.  Unfortunately, even with less flavoring, there was still a lingering after-taste.  I have talked with friends of mine who like the MIO products, and they have suggested that maybe it is the ""tea"" part of the flavoring that is leaving the after-taste, as they have not had that problem with other flavors of the product.Overall, I am disappointed that this product did not live up to my expectaions.  Although I know of people who use and like this flavoring, I am not sure I will be purchasing any additional flavors.  The cost of this item in grocery stores is somewhat high, and I am hesitant to purchase a 4-pk from Amazon in the event that I won't use them.  The overpowering smell, as well as the after-taste from the flavoring has led me to determine that I will be best served by continuing to use crystal light.UPDATE*******While my rating of the peach tea remains the same, armed with a high value coupon I did purchase another flavor of MIO - this time the strawberry-watermelon flavor, and I was very pleased with the results.  I will be posting a review for that item later.",2,"too ""artificial"" tasting for my tastes",1325635200

It's about three weeks into its process and I think It's going to be only slightly less strong; I'll probably let it sit a bit longer.

I couldn't bake a cookie as good from scratch, but anyway, you'll think they are from scratch, and so will anyone you feed them to.

Pull them out when they still look a little underdone in the center and the edges are just slightly golden brown.  They are done.  Just need to cool.

27011,AI0BCEWRE04G0,B00CBHR1NY,Stoney,"Tapioca pearls and pudding (or custard) are two different things.  Theoretically, you can mix hydrated tapioca pearls in pre-made pudding, coconut pudding, ""instant"" pudding (which in my opinion tastes horrible), or pudding from scratch--but that's alot of work).  I use the following easy recipe which makes great tasting tapioca pudding.> Begin with 2 cups of milk in a 4-cup measuring cup*> Microwave 2 minutes> Stir-in 1/4 cup ofBob's Red Mill Tapioca, Small Pearl, 24-Ounce Units (Pack of 4)**> Stir-in 2 tablespoons of sugar***> Stir-in 1 tablespoon ofBird's Custard Powder 300g, slowly, a little at a time, mixing vigorously****> Microwave 2 minutes, stir> Microwave 30 seconds, stir, repeat, until thick.  If you are uncertain about the thickness, then microwave 15 seconds at a time until you are sure---you can't really overcook it.  Watch the level in the measuring cup--if it gets near the top (i.e., nearly boils over) stop the microwave immediately.NOTES* I generally use whole milk but you can use 1/2 & 1/2 for richer pudding, or 2% or skim milk for a less-rich pudding.  The custard mix contains no eggs, so tapioca pudding made with soy or almond milk would probably be vegan.  It is important to use a large measuring cup or mixing bowl because the pudding can boil over in a few seconds**  You can presoak the pearls (in milk) as long as overnight if you want, if you want them to be softer in the freshly made pudding.  In my opinion, about 4-hours of presoak is ideal.  If you don't pre-soak, the pearls will soften over time in the frig.*** Mix vigorously, I strongly recommend a mini-mixer such asNorpro Cordless Mini Mixer, 5 Piece Set(which costs only $4 and is very useful for other mixing chores).  Get a good whirlpool going with the mini-mixer, and slowly add the sugar and then the custard mix.  It is important to add the pearls first, because they act as mixing balls to help incorporate the pudding mix faster and easier.**** This is about 1/4--1/2 the amount of mix that Bird's recipe calls for. The tapioca pearls take up volume and themselves contribute starch to the mix which is cooked and thickens the pudding.MAKING NON-TAPIOCCA CUSTARD> Use the above recipe, without tapioca pearls but with about 2 tablespoons of custard mix for a custard sauce, or  2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons of custard mix to make a firm cold pudding.ADJUSTING THE RECIPE> One reviewer, probably trying to make an American-style firm cold pudding, complained that the Bird's Custard is thin and bland.  It is, if you use the recipe on the container which is really intended for a warm custard sauce.  For a cold rich firm pudding, you need to increase both the amount of the custard mix and the amount of the sugar (as in my recipe).  Whole milk or real half-and-half make a much richer sauce or pudding than skim milk.> Obviously, if you serve it warm, it is much thinner than the same batch refrigerated overnight.  No problem, just be aware of the fact, and adjust your recipe accordingly.> Less obviously, if you serve it warm, it will be sweeter than the same batch refrigerated overnight.  No problem, just be award of the fact, and adjust your recipe accordingly.> If you are serving it as a sauce on an already sweet dessert, such as fruitcake, you may want to reduce the amount of sugar.> If you want to pour the sauce over sliced bananas or most other cut fruit, let it cool down first.> You can, of course, double (triple, etc.) the recipe if you need more custard---just beware that the cooking times are not proportional.  Multiple small batches may be easier.> Most folks tend to over-measure for small volumes, under-measure for large volumes, so a doubled recipe is likely to produce a thinner sauce or pudding.  Not a problem, just beware of it.  I strongly suggest using a real measuring spoon, and measure level volumes (that means, use a butter knife to level the filled-tablespoon at the top edge of the tablespoon).  Don't ""cheat"" by using ""heaping"" tablespoons, instead just add 1/2 tablespoon (or 1 tablespoon, etc.) to your recipe.> When you find the exact combination of milk, custard mix, and sugar which works best for you, write it down, and use that recipe the next time.  Heaven knows, with the 600g container you've got more than enough to experiment with.",5,EASY TAPIOCA PUDDING RECIPE,1382486400

The box is very fun for the kids to look at.  My oldest spent about 20 mintues just looking at the pictures on the outside of the box.  Finding the tatoo inside was a suprise for her as well.  The inside had fun jokes and a word find, along with some interesting factoids.  Better for older child than mine.I had both of them try to assemble the spork and they could.  I think some of the packaging would be tough for a child to open alone.  I opened everything and split it between the two kids.  The teacher would have to help my oldest if I sent this as a school lunch.Neither of the kids would eat the cheese.  They thought it was swiss and would not touch it since it was not cold from the fridge.  I served it as it would be if we had it as the box suggests.  I chilled the cheese and they still did not like it.My youngest did not like the turkey stick, oldest ate it all.Both scarffed the gummy bears, but we have these regularly since they are allergen free and natural.Each liked the snap pea crips, another item we have had before.Neither liked the sunflower crunch thing.

However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I needed a main dish in a hurry because I was short on time.  I used a 13 oz. can of chicken instead of cooking up some and it worked out fine.I tossed everything except the cheese into a 2-quart size pot, stirred as directed, added the cheese as directed, stirred it again and served it.  Yes, the broccoli was scant, but since I had steamed fresh broccoli to go with the meal it didn't matter.  Everyone seemed to like it including me and I really thought it was going to be pretty awful because of some the reviews.  Even my kid who is real finicky about cheese in her food liked it and ate all that I put on her plate.  The other kid asked for 2nds of it.I know that it's not the healthiest, most nutritious or even anything really good for you about it, but I realized that this stuff would be a fantastic camp or emergency situation food, assuming you had a camp stove to heat up the water and boil the rice/pasta.  It's got a lot of calories which would be good for camping especially if you do some hiking, and if a winter storm blows through knocking the power off for a couple of days this would be great to cook up on the camp stove.  It would be especially good if you had some canned chicken to add, but even without it I think it would be eaten quite quickly.I'll most likely buy some of this just too store for times that it might be needed and to take it camping with us.  It would really make cooking a meal easier since everything goes into one pot.

Oh, there is some chipotle puree way down on the ingredient list (listed under the label ""contains less than 2% of""), but it only lends a hint of chipotle flavor to the sauce.  It's more akin to mayonnaise with a few dashes of pepper added than to a real chipotle sauce - nothing ""bold"" here at all.As it does have a somewhat pleasant (though overwhelmingly bland) taste, I'll give this Taco Bell sauce a bit of credit.

Even drenched in milk for several minutes, it retained a wicked crunch that rattled my teeth a bit.The good news, it was very good tasting, the berries and the brown sugar and other sweetners made it a cereal I wish that was easier to eat.  Plus there is no reason to add any sugar or other sweetners too it, it stood well on its own.  The box was small, but still supplied 4 reasonable bowls of the stuff.  These kind of cereals are not puffed up, or otherwise full of air, so they fill you up without eating half a big box. The box has the interesting feature of a window to see the contents, something I wish more food cartons had.Unfortunately, it could have used a lot more berries, and maybe something softer to chew through than whatever those flakes are cemented with. More bad news, I checked the price, and at five bucks a box plus a salty shipping charge, I couldn't recommend it.

They're  mass-produced, very sweet cookies that are fall-apart-in-your-hand soft and only slightly chewy, with a creamy--not fudgey--center. It's not as though you can't find really tasty, quality cookies in a package at the supermarket, but these are not first-class cookies even on the scale of what the big companies crank out by the millions. For example, Pepperidge Farm's soft-baked Captiva and Chocolate Chunk cookies are very similar in concept, but superior.The word ""fudge""--let alone ""Megafudge""--may conjure up Willie Wonka-like fantasies, or have you thinking you'll be biting into a big block of deep, dark chocolate fudge.  No, no, no. They're chocolate alright, but they look and sound a lot more chocolatey than they taste--not the kind you get from a bar of dark chocolate or premium chocolate ice cream, let alone fudge, but a disappointing, how-can-something-so-dark-brown-have-so-little-chocolate-flavor kind of taste. I can picture these being formulated in a lab by men in white coats, using jars of brown and white powders and syrups in test tubes. That kind of ""chocolate."" Those reviewers who squeal that these have a rich chocolate flavor sadly don't know what they're missing.  They're also smaller than I expected; maybe two inches in diameter, not the sort of three- or four-inch disks you'd likely find in a bakery (or the Pepperidge Farm varieties), or would make at home; you'll need two or three just to feel like you've eaten something.If you put some in your child's lunch, will he or she like them?  Why not--he or she will likely be enjoying the sugar rush for an hour before falling asleep.  If you sit down in front of the TV with them can you eat ten of them before you know it?  Sure.

As others have said, there is four-layer protection here. The can itself has a screw top, then there's a pop-top to open the container, then there's a foil bag, and finally there's a silicate anti-moisture pack in the bag. This is as close to freshly-ground as you can possibly get in a shipped product. The tea was the neon-green color top-quality matcha should be, and I am very happy with the taste of my first cup. People with a serious palate like me might say this isn't the very best taste available in the world, but it is certainly worth of the &#34;ceremonial&#34; banner- I would feel proud to offer this tea to my most esteemed guests.Note to beginners: Matcha should be made at a lower temperate than most black teas. If you pour boiling water over your matcha powder you're basically roasting it on the spot and altering the flavor. Traditionally, you should boil the water as normal and then allow it to cool for a few minutes (to around 80C/180F) before making your tea. To maintain this lower temperature, you may also want to swirl a bit of the hot water in cups before making tea, so the cups don't chill the tea further before drinking.There's certainly a good caffeine high- I can see why others claim this product produces exceptional clarity. Part of it is likely the absolute freshness, as you're getting the product at its peak. Someone coming from bagged or even bulk loose-leaf tea is likely to notice the difference.

Usually such cheese cracker snacks don't make me feel so good afterward, even after just one - don't know why, they don't set well in my stomach and give me heartburn even though I like them. But when I tried these (coupon plus sale...) - no problem at all even if I ate more than one at a sitting, although they really are quite filling so one is generally enough (big crackers, span the width of the box). Don't know what's different about them that makes them not bother me at all, but that's my experience. They definitely taste very good, much better than the usual ones of this type. I tried the cheddar and also the 4 cheese one, same experience with both although I especially like the cheddar. Definitely a lot more cheese filling than in the typical smaller ones. The crackers themselves are quite tasty also, must be the whole grain included. They actually have a decent amount of fiber, if you're looking for an excuse to eat junk food... One big cracker has only 130 calories but 3 grams fiber, which is a very good fiber-to-calorie ratio (I need a lot of fiber or else my innards self-destruct, so I pay attention) and enough to put them in the high-fiber snack category, and as a bonus they aren't sweet (I hate sweet until evening).

That product comes it at 160 calories and has a ton of vitamins and minerals.  When I saw this product, I was excited since I love oatmel and nuts and cherries --- I thought I would have a nice alternative to my usual breakfast rotation items.Imagine my surprise when I looked on the package and discovered this product has 290 calories and 19 grams of sugar.  In addition, the only vitamins and minerals on the label are 8% calcium and 10% iron.  No vitamin A, no thiamin, no niacin, no vitamin B, etc.  On the surface, this product didn't stack up well against my usual Quaker oatmeal.  Ignoring that, I went ahead and prepared the oatmeal per the directions thinking a fabulous taste could offset some of my hesitancy.  While the product directions were very clear and the heating process worked well, I didn't particularly care for the taste of the oatmeal either.  I have a very strong sweet tooth and very rarely find food items to be too sweet but that was the case here.  It was more sugary sweet than I care for.  It was edible and I consumed the entire container, but those last few bites actually weren't tasty.When I started to write this review, I initially thought I would rate the oatmeal 3-stars since I was able to eat it and didn't throw it out but upon further reflection, I decided 2-stars was more appropriate.

Not a huge, coma-inducing dessert or a giant piece of fruit, but something that will kill off my craving for sweet. And in chocolate, if possible.SnackWell's Brownie Bites fit the bill perfectly. They've put the little desserts in separate packets. I think that would really help these stay fresh (if they're around long enough). Each little packet comes with 9 Bites inside. If you're with friends you can share a couple and still have a few left for yourself. At 45 calories per packet, that's only 5 calories per Bite. I was conservative and had 2. That's 10 calories, which really isn't bad for a midday snack.The color of the fudge creme version is very dark, there's a bit of icing, a thin layer of fudge creme and under that is a layer of brownie-like cake. The flavor is pretty darn good, very chocolate-y and natural tasting, not fake. I like the texture too: extremely chewy, much like a fudge brownie. The icing isn't too waxy, either.I'd recommend these Bites to anyone seeking a bit of sinful chocolate indulgence without the guilt that goes with diving whole-hog into a pan of brownies.

26542,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B00AMCHGW6,Kate McMurry,"These are the pros of this product:It has a decent taste. It has 6 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber. It is sweetened with stevia rather than some awful artificial sweetener, and secondarily with evaporated cane syrup rather than high fructose corn syrup.These are the cons of this product:It contains maltodextrin and natural flavor, which are moderately unhealthy. It contains carrageenan, which is awful for one's health. For more detailed information on these ingredients, see below.I cannot see any motivation other than ignorance or greed for a company claiming to offer the public a supposed ""healthy,"" chocolate drink to flavor it with ""natural flavor"" rather than with actual chocolate! South Beach missed a major opportunity to use real, dark chocolate or dark cocoa that is actually greatly beneficial to the health and instead decided to utilize unhealthy, lab-created chemicals that merely mimic the taste of chocolate.In addition, there was no need to add maltodextrin as a thickener, when the drink already contains the more healthy ingredient of guar gum.Worst of all, there is no excuse whatsoever for using the thickener carrageenan, a truly awful ingredient that ought to be banned.As far as I'm concerned, this is a product to be avoided. And I see no real point to it. It only takes about 2-3 minutes to make a chocolate smoothie in a blender, and there are multiple ways to do it. (I will be glad to post suggested recipes for anyone who wants them.) If time is the issue on a work day, then you can blend one up the night before, store it in the refrigerator (preferably in a glass or stainless steel container, rather than plastic such as this product is stored in). When it is time to use it, simply shake it well--exactly as you would have to do with this product--when you're ready to drink it.Ingredients: Water, Protein Blend (Whey Protein Concentrate, Nonfat Dry Milk), Soluble Corn Fiber, Evaporated Cane Syrup, High Oleic Sunflower Oil, Cocoa (Processed with Alkali), Natural Flavor, Locust Bean Gum, Guar Gum, Maltodextrin, Carrageenan, Soy Lecithen, Salt, Rebaudioside A (Stevia).IMPORTANT: Must be refrigerated after opening to maintain safety. Serve chilled. Shake well.Nutrition Facts:Serving Size: 8 fl ozCalories: 100Carrageenan: This common additive in food and cosmetics is extracted from a red seaweed called Chondrus crispus, commonly known as Irish moss. Carrageenan is used as a thickener and emulsifier. Much research over many years has shown that repeated exposure to carrageenan causes inflammation, which is viewed as the root cause of most serious disease, including arthritis, bowel disease, heart disease and cancer, among many others. In fact, drug investigators frequently use carrageenan to create inflammation in tissues in order to test the anti-inflammatory properties of new drugs. Finally, exposure to low doses of carrageenan for as little as 18 days can create profound glucose intolerance and impair insulin action, which are precursors to diabetes.Maltodextrin: This is a food additive that is either without taste or slightly sweet. It is commonly used in the processed-food industry as a thickener or filler, to improve the texture and appearance in processed food. As a relatively cheap ingredient, it can also add more bulk to a given product, thereby increasing profits for the company using it. In the U.S., most of the time it is derived from rice, corn, or potato starch. Through a process called hydrolysis, the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids. Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further, resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water. People who are allergic to gluten should be aware that maltodextrin can sometimes be derived from barley or wheat. Per the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA), all FDA-regulated food products that contain maltodextrin derived from wheat must include the word ""wheat"" on the food label. In the case of USDA-regulated foods (meat, poultry, and egg products), this warning is not required on the label, so beware of products such as soups with meat in them which say they contain maltodextrin. However, products such as jams and powdered substances which contain maltodextrin, are required by law to say ""wheat"" in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheat.Natural Flavor: The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is.",2,"It has some lousy ingredients for a supposed ""health food""",1397692800

There are even more expensive brands, but why bother.  None of them taste significantly better, and some actually taste not quite as good.

Anyway, the Moser Roth is pretty good, it's 85% dark chocolate and melts faster than the Lindt, but not as fast as the Ghiradelli.  The flavor is similar, but recognizably different.  The downside of the Moser Roth is that it often has bits of congealed harder chocolate in it (at least, I hope it's chocolate).  As a result, I usually get the Lindt and Ghiradelli instead.

And with Amazon's subscribe and save, you can save a little more and have it delivered to your door (even more convenience!).About 6 servings are in each bag, at 230 calories a serving.

Please note this product contains wheat, eggs, and milk.The taste is quite good.  The three cheeses are Swiss Emmenthal, Ricotta, and Grana Padano. I think the Grana Padano gives it a nice texture, while the Emmenthal and Ricotta keep it light.  It is OK plain, but I always prefer sauce.  For this sampling, I took the bag's recommendation: ""Tortellini is perfect when paired simply with melted butter or extra virgin olive oil, topped by a generous sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan cheese.""  I melted 2 tablespoons of butter with 1/2 cup of oil and seasoned it with parsley and grated parmesan.  And I added one tablespoon of minced garlic for a very garlicky punch.  It gave the pasta a nice coating without saturating the noodles and making it soggy.  It was delicious.  And the sauce was super easy.  I could see how marinara could be good with these tortellini, but again I did not try it.  Plus sauce is really a matter of taste, so you should try what you like best.Preparation is very easy, too.

We find that just keeping these in the freezer, then cutting the top of an individual package open and zapping it in the microwave for 25 seconds is the best way to handle storage and preparation.  Wash it down with a hot drink such as coffee or chai tea, and it's a pretty satisfying breakfast on the go.  My wife packs a two-pack of frozen veggie sausage and a small paper plate along with my lunch.  After I arrive at work, I supplement the coffee and cookie I had along the way with the sausage. (Morning Star Farms soy sausage tastes pretty much like traditional sausage to me, but it's less greasy, and can be zapped for 1 minute, 25 seconds on a paper plate by way of prep.)  I usually have old-fashioned V-8 or one of the veggie/fruit fusion versions as well.  Sometimes we switch it up and go with some of the better tasting turkey sausages -- surprisingly, Jimmy Dean has them.  My wife sticks to the cookie (there are lots of different flavors) and chai tea, then has the veggie sausage as a mid-morning snack with brown mustard.  She doesn't have the V-8 until mid-afternoon, after soup for lunch.  (My lunch is usually a 6-in. Subway or something relatively substantial.)I've lost weight slowly, which in my case is a good thing. Remember, these are 300 calorie cookies, so plan accordingly. I used to have a home-made breakfast sandwich every morning, and now do the sandwich only on occasion. I'm getting older, and don't need quite as many calories as I used to. In case anyone is curious, the breakfast sandwich consisted of two slices of whole grain bread, a slice of thin, pre-sliced ham (prefer Dap), and an Eggbeater omelet my wife makes. You spray olive oil to coat the insides of a microwaveable 2 C. (you can use a 4 C if you want the eggs spread out more) measuring cup, add about 300 ml. of Eggbeaters (I like their Southwestern-style), a T. or 2 T. of chunky salsa (we like Pace), and a couple of large pinches of your favorite pre-grated cheese (we like Sargento's light 3 cheese or ""Mexican"" cheese.) Cover and zap for about 4 minutes, or until fluffy and done.  Slap it between the bread with the ham, and away you go. Hungry guys can add one or two whole eggs to the whole thing, as it just takes longer to zap, say 6 to 6.30 minutes.",5,Breakfast on the Go for oatmeal lovers.,1347148800
48785,A2ZRQBRJIE7H0F,B0013Z1R1W,Dunyazad,"I had been looking around for a good granola bar for a while now, and I think my search has finally come to an end. This is almost exactly what I was looking for: a tasty granola bar that has at least some nutritional value--in this case, 9 grams of fiber, or 35% of the recommended daily value.To be clear, this is not a health food. You only need to look at the 10g of sugar to determine that. But it fills the niche I was looking for: it's an easy, portable carb-based food that I can add to my lunch when I'm on the go. I generally pair it with a couple of hard-boiled eggs and an apple, so I'm not too worried about including one element that's a bit more of a treat. The fact that there's a lot of fiber means that it helps keep me full longer, so that I can get pretty far on a 400-calorie lunch. The bar itself contributes 140 of those calories, which I know some people will consider too much, but I don't mind at all when I'm actually trying to produce a complete meal.Where this bar really excels is in the taste. I've had a lot of high-fiber products that have been awful, dry and tasteless. This bar is moist and delicious, and the chocolate doesn't hurt either. There are times when I eat one on its own and actually find it a bit too sweet (again, it's those 10g of sugar--although many bars have even more than that), but when I put it together with some savory foods, I find that it's just right. I honestly never thought that a high-fiber bar could taste this good.The only serious downside I see is that there can be a temptation to eat too many of these. And while fiber is generally a good thing, consuming too much of it all at once is not. When I ate two of these bars in a short period, my digestive system was not very happy about it. That's probably just as well, though: I don't mind including one of these in my lunch two or three times a week, but they're not quite healthy enough that I'd really want to be eating more than one in a day. In addition to the sugar, there's a whole long list of typical processed-food ingredients that should probably be consumed in moderation, if at all.So, I'm happy with this because it has a lot of fiber and tastes great. It has its place in my diet. But it's still a processed food with added sugar, so like all such foods, it should be approached with caution. If the nutrition info fits your needs, though, I suspect you'll like the taste.",5,So good,1352505600

McGee ""KayJay""","I bought this because I'm trying to find a decent alternative to Splenda that I can use in beverages and baking.I drink LOTS of iced tea, all year round and that's primarily what I hoped to use this for. Unfortunately, I did not like the taste of it in my beloved iced tea. I admit I'm picky about my iced tea and this just didn't taste good to me.It's pretty good in hot teas and I made an apple cake that was heavenly! I'd recommend using the tartest apples you can find such as granny smith because the recipe called for one cup of sugar and I used only a scant half cup of the agave, it was plenty sweet. When I make the recipe again, I'll use slightly less.I made peanut butter oatmeal cookies and they were good but I did notice that the bottoms brown MUCH MUCH faster when I use this syrup than when I use Splenda. I'd definitely recommend using insulated cookie sheets or slightly lowering the oven temp for cookie recipes. Also though my recipe calls for creamy peanut butter, next time I'll use crunchy because the cookie batter was pretty sticky which can also cause the bottoms to brown faster. To ""fix"" the cookie batter I made, I added chopped peanuts and that seemed to help.I also made banana bread with this and usually my banana bread (made with half whole wheat flour and half white flour) has a pretty dense texture. Using this syrup made it have a ""fall apart"" density/texture which sort of annoyed me though it did have a good flavor. Next time I'll try using slightly less and see if that doesn't help it hold together more.The downside to this syrup is that I, like many other reviewers, received one bottle that had leaked and WHAT A HORRIBLE MESS! Also the bottles are just wrong. The opening causes drips and no matter how hard I tried not to let it, it would always drip down the side of the bottle and required wiping off with a wet paper towel. I didn't see on the bottle if this required refrigeration after opening or not. I just refrigerated just in case and it fell over inside my refrigerator and though the cap was tightly screwed on and closed, it leaked in there too and was a big pain to clean off the glass shelf and I cannot imagine the nightmare if you have the open wire kind of shelves because at least it was contained on just one shelf in my fridge.Bottom line: Unfortunately, I still like the taste of Splenda better though I'm afraid it's not good for me and also, the agave is NOT portable and cannot really be taken with you easily to use away from home.

The box consists of a cooking bag containing quinoa, brown rice, red rice, and wild rice, as well as a packet for making the dressing, and a separate packet of cranberries and almonds.  Assembling the salad is a breeze:  Drop the bag in boiling water for 17 minutes; add a tablespoon of olive oil and water to the dressing mix; and then mix everything together.  Serve warm or cold.The results were excellent, too.  I served the sample I received to my family, consisting of one very fussy eater, one vegetarian, and one easily pleased husband.  The fussy eater said &#34;It's okay, I guess.&#34;  The vegetarian loved it and asked me to make it again soon.  The husband liked it but said he could live without the almonds.  I thought it was quite tasty.  The dressing is very sweet, almost too sweet, maybe.  A 2/3 cup serving has 220 calories as a result.  The nutritional value of quinoa and wild/brown rice helps to make up for the calories, though.  And a pleasant surprise is that a serving only has 170 mg of sodium (7% of the RDA), which is substantially lower than you will find in most processed food mixes.The salad is visually appealing, too, and fancy enough to serve to company.  In short, this is a great-tasting salad mix that would be a good staple to have on hand in your pantry for nights when you need to fix a side dish on short notice.",5,A tasty side dish for summer,1405641600

In essence, a treat that goes far and above what the usual mass marketed candy that passes for chocolate in this county.These truffles suffer from a taste  that reminds me of a stick of butter with the regular chocolate that is incorporated within the truffle adding a grittiness that I did not care for.  There is also an aftertaste upon swallowing that I found a bit unpleasant.

Main reason: raw or lightly cooked buckwheat has the highest concentration of a nutrient called rutin, more than any other food. A recent paper discovered that rutin is as good as any anti-coagulation medicine in preventing the formation of harmful blood clots in the legs and elsewhere (actually better, because there are no side-effects) in people with that tendency. Google rutin for more info.As for taste - I like it, using it as the basis of a complete evening meal.

Since Milky Way (a combination of chocolate and caramel) is one of my favorite candies, I was looking forward to tasting Werther's Original Caramel Chocolate.  I found this candy pleasing, but not in anyway outstanding or even remarkable.  The candy comes in thin oval shaped wafers, which measure about one and three quarters inches at the longest point and are individually wrapped in an attractive gold foil with a horizontal red stripe along the lower part.  The candy itself is soft and creamy, with a nice blend of chocolate and caramel flavor.  It was distinctly on the sweet side - actually a little too sweet for my taste, so I was not particularly interested eating a second one immediately after consuming the first.  According to the ""Nutrition Facts"" on the package, there are 10 grams of saturated fat in 6 pieces.In view of the cost of this product, which figures to about $9.00 for a pound of chocolate, the way it is packaged, and its distinct sweetness, this product would be suitable for serving to guests after dinner or possibly to keep around the house if what you crave is  only a small taste of a sweet chocolate.

One benefit is there is very little after taste at all - so that is a plus. The store brand envelopes made for Sam's Club are stronger in sweetness and very little after taste too. I can't remember if the Sam's brand states `extract' or not, and don't have an envelope handy. The problem using envelopes in cooking is a pain. Stevia characteristically does not pour easy and is sensitive to humidity. This brand also pours easier than extracts.

Certainly these from Kellogg's are delicious, and I could easily eat a bag or two or three without complaint. The mixed berry flavor is great, and as far as taste alone, I give this candy a high rating.It does concern me, however, that some of the other reviewers are thrilled by the 100% daily value of vitamin C. Yes, that is nice and it's better than no vitamins at all, but as far as health is concerned, you really need to call this what it is: candy.Corn syrup, sugar, corn starch and gelatin is what you're eating and each tiny bag packs a full 11g of sugar. Thankfully there are only 70 calories per bag, which is not so bad, but please don't substitute these gummies for actual fruit and don't be so impressed by the 100% daily value of vitamin C. Eating one orange a day will give you much more than that and at least the sugar will be natural and not corn syrup.OVERALL: Like most candy, the taste is delicious and is sure to please any appetite. Unfortunately the ingredients are the same old corn syrup. I was hoping in our more health-conscious society that Kelloggs might bring something new to the table.

To test this, pour a packet of xylitol granules into your mouth and chew it around a little. In a minute or two, your mouth will be full of saliva.  Used this way, xylitol can protect and remineralize your teeth.

It's a little less sweet than sugar, but has less calories and supposedly helps prevent tooth decay. However if you're sensitive to dietary things, start slow and work your way up. I didn't have a problem, but it can cause diarrhea if you're not careful. It's also toxic to animals so make sure to clean well if spilled. I love it and prefer it to sugar in my coffee now!

It was way too expensive to keep buying, so I considered TASTE NIRVANA.( I know a lot of coconut waters can be pricey)I mention the sugar content per unit, even if it may be natural sugar because hypoglycemics and diabetics have to be mindful that this does have some sugar in it.  If you divide the serving in half- it has less of an impact on blood sugar levels.As in 8 ounces at a time rather than the 16 ounces at once.Is this better than Gatorade when it comes to ingredients? Yes.But as others have pointed out when talking about re-hydration, you don't just need potassium, you need some degree of salt as well. The magnesium levels in each serving are negligible here.Out of other contenders for this product line of coconut water made by many companies, this one comes out ahead for sure, in that it is pure coconut water.But if sugar matters- natural or added= remember that 4 grams of sugar equals 1 tablespoon.This  blows the minds of people who are sucking down regular sodas of every flavor and brand like crazy.After having one can of Coke they realize after doing the math, that they had about 10 teaspoons of sugar in that drink.MIND BLOWING FOR SO MANY OF THEM, JUST  VISUALIZING TEASPOON AFTER TEASPOON BEING PUT INTO EACH CAN!It is sickening to realize how addicted the USA is to sugar and how it is in so many products( often hidden in other forms that sugar can take- like corn syrup for example).Some reports have now indicated sugar is addictive and as someone who has to work very hard  on controlling their sweet tooth, I believe it.Another reason this product comes out on top, is when compared to Gatorade, Gatorade has chemicals and dyes in it that are NOT healthy for people.I would only use something like Gatorade if I had a person sick with a fever who was losing electrolytes from vomiting-sweating-etc due to  such an illness.Or maybe buy Pedialyte which is usually used for infants, small children and certain animals in distress.If you are not worried about the sugar content in this product( which actually pales in comparison to so many other drinks-try this.One plus for the natural sugar that IS in it, is this:it beats having artificial sweeteners in it, which for the most part, are toxic chemicals and have been studied for neurological effects among other  reactions by consumers.",4,Still- it has approx 5 tablespoons sugar per unit(16 oz),1377129600

This blend is perfect not only for my own situation but also for the flavors: each distinct, recognizable, and unique. Almonds. Pistachios. Cashews. Great variety! Think about it.Mixed in with the nuts are dried apples and dried cranberries. Again, two distinct flavors, one milder and softer, the other chewier and tarter.We used some of these at home, and then took the rest of the 18-count batch on our recent trip to Israel.

Each of the 12 slim 100g packets contains 2 thin, crisp layers of the cherishedCrawfords Garibaldi Biscuits, divided into five sections. Please note, these are not big boxes of cookies! Ingredients include: currants (40%), wheat flour, vegetable oil [not hydrogenated Palm Kernel, thankfully], sugar, dried skimmed milk, and baking soda.We are about to escape to the comforts ofHetty Wainthropp Investigates, and look forward to nibbling on rations of Garibaldi biscuits with cups ofPG Tips Black Tea. Another biscuit brand,McVitie's, claims that 52 digestive biscuits per second are consumed in the U.K. per day. This robust figure doesn't even include Garibaldis!Now I know why Manchester, U.K., based DCI Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister) ofLife On Marsloves these crispy biscuits! And surely, the Northumberland, U.K., DCIsGeorge GentlyandVera Stanhopeenjoy them too, with their elevenses on blustery days. English mysteries and tea biscuits are delightful sustenance.

My husband generally dislikes canned beans even after rinsing and he didn't complain about them in this meal.Cons- flavor. We like a lot of flavor in our chili. We keep a jar of mixed seasonings on hand that uses 2 kinds of chiles, cumin, garlic, onion and a small amount of cayenne for homemade chili and my family is used to a lot of flavor.

What I read told me that this sugar was evaporated American grown cane sugar, and the price was better than that in my local natural foods store, plus, I have Amazon Prime, so I could easily have it delivered on a day of my choice that fit their delivery schedule.Since I got the first bottle I've used this sugar in some of my special organic gourmet canning batches, and in kefir water.

In fact the kefir grains need sugar to grow the water into a probiotic drink and since my intention is to enhance my health I want the best ingredients I can use.

To date, Keebler Cinnamon Grahams have been my choice (or secondarily, HoneyMaid, since Keebler is getting harder to find) so I was interested to try Back to Nature's Apple Cinnamon Oat Graham Crackers.Regarding taste -- Keebler is sweet and cinnamon-y, very easy to eat. Back to Nature is a ""healthier,"" more adult taste -- far less sweet, more graham-y, just a touch of cinnamon (mostly incorporated into the cracker, not dusted on top), with less fat and more fiber. My only quibble is that its apple flavor tastes high (somehow almost separate from the cracker), thin and artificial despite the package's assurance that it's from apple juice concentrate.Regarding texture -- while both brands are crisp, Keebler is friable while Back to Nature is sturdy. And while Keebler absorbs moisture out of the air and quickly becomes stale, Back to Nature stays crisper -- in one case, in a zipper sandwich bag through a weekend while I was away. But note - I'm not sure I'd buy graham crackers by mail order; my package arrived with about a third of the crackers broken.Bottom line: choose the traditional supermarket brands if you want a sweet, airy cracker that practically dissolves in your mouth; choose Back to Nature if you want a more complex, satisfying snack.",4,A Satisfying Snack,1299456000

Since then I've tried a couple of the different bands of whole raw chia seeds. This is my first time trying the milled variety. My first impression is that the milled version is a lot more dense than the seeds. The consistency of the mass reminds me of brown sugar - both the color and the texture. The weight is lighter though. I mix the chia seeds into something - usually yogurt or oatmeal. With the milled seeds I found that you need to decrease the amount used, by around half. There didn't seem to be any difference in taste between the whole seeds and the milled - but I did notice that were you occasionally got a bad tasting seed with whole ones, that hasn't happened with the ground seeds. I don't know if this is due to the milling process or that Nutiva has better quality seeds (probably both). The taste if you never eaten any of these is a bit earthy - but very subtle. Sort of reminds me of the aftertaste you sometimes get when eating pecans that you've shelled yourself. The main difference between the two is the texture. The whole seeds tend to be a bit pebbly, whereas the milled really doesn't have much of a texture and mixes better.

I experimented with tying the tie until I found a tightness that would hold the coffeemaker closed during a brew and then left that knot in place. I slide the pre-tied tie onto the coffeemaker when I'm ready to start a brew and slide it off when finished. It works like a charm, and no leaks!------------------------------------The Ekobrew makes a good cup of coffee with my Keurig-style maker, a Mr. Coffee BVMC-KG5-001 purchased on 12/24/12 - it is similar to one made with a French press in that all the coffee oils, etc., come through as they aren't trapped on a paper filter.  There is a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the cup (as with a French press), but it is very fine and not gritty.  If you couldn't see it, you probably wouldn't know it was there.  I had to experiment with the amount of coffee to add to the Ekobrew and found that filling it to the ""fill line"" was the right amount for a 10-oz cup.  I use pre-ground coffee from the grocery store (Peet's, Starbucks).Cleanup of the Ekobrew is very easy.  I just tap the bottom of it with my hand over the wastebasket and then rinse and allow it to air dry.  According to the instructions, the Ekobrew is dishwasher safe and should be washed in the dishwasher about once per month to remove built-up oils.Now the ""but"" part -- Although the manufacturer states that the Ekobrew isn't compatible with the Mr. Coffee BVMC-KG5, I purchased it anyway because several online reviewers stated that they got it to fit by lifting the handle on the top part of the Mr. Coffee while closing it.  Unfortunately, this trick didn't work for the current version of this model.  The lid on the Ekobrew is too thick for the top of the Mr. Coffee to close over it.  The top of the Mr. Coffee closes at an angle to the brew chamber and hits the rear portion of the Ekobrew, leaving a gap between the top and bottom portions of the Mr. Coffee.  The top and bottom needles of the Mr. Coffee line up perfectly with the Ekobrew, so I found that I can just squeeze the top and bottom portions of the Mr. Coffee brew chamber together and hold them closed while using the Ekobrew. The rubber gasket around the top needle still makes a good seal, and coffee brews without any leaks. I tried putting a rubber band around the top and bottom portions of the Mr. Coffee brew chamber to hold them closed, but it was too weak and couldn't hold the Mr. Coffee closed sufficiently to allow a brew to start.I also found that the Ekobrew leaves a coffee residue inside the Mr. Coffee brew chamber.  It's difficult to clean this out because of the sharp needles, but I do it very carefully with a small piece of paper towel moistened with water.",4,"Makes Good Coffee, But...",1357257600

The batter is a deep, dark chocolate color that stays that way until you take the cake out of the oven.The texture of the cake is soft and moist.

It is first placed in a polyethylene bag and then into  a clean burlap bag that has a zipper and the top is sewn down. The rice is clean and being brown rice it is healthier than white rice.

The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.I am now addicted toCelestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.

Then it's very good. You could also simply make your own sauce out of cream and an egg yolk, as an alfredo sauce, and skip this altogher, since you are already cooking bacon and adding cheese. Freshly ground pepper helps this also. This is way too soupy with the addition of 2.5 cups of water and .5 cups of milk.

The pretzels are also very tasty and shaped either like bunnies or like carrots, much to the amusement of both of my children (and, I confess, myself).  We were so hooked on these that I immediately looked for them on Amazon and set up a subscribe and save, which is also more economical than purchasing boxes at my local store.What I can't emphasize enough about Annie's products is that they are real food.

I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur, but I have tasted a great many honeys in my lifetime (favourites being orange blossom, wildflower, followed closely by saw palmetto) and was definitely open to trying a new one--manuka--especially after hearing about its many wonderful qualities and health benefits.When the package arrived, I didn't like that it was in a plastic jar and would have preferred glass (kudos for being in a *dark* jar, though). The honey itself was paler in colour than saw palmetto, which is a very light amber-gold, and was cloudy (reminded me of raw, unfiltered honey). The scent was distinctly floral, reminiscent of jasmine blossom, and the taste also had a lovely floral undertone (not quite jasmine, but close). That said, to some who don't enjoy floral honeys or flavours, that could be a turn-off. Also, this honey wasn't overly sweet--in fact, I'd rate its sweetness on the milder side, so much so I could easily eat a tablespoonful undiluted.After the undiluted taste test, I tried it in various capacities (tea, on a pb sandwich, toast, in some desserts which called for honey) and while I personally didn't enjoy it in my herbal teas (figured the floral undertones would enhance the flavour), it's a relatively versatile honey overall (especially tasty on lightly buttered toast). Although manuka hasn't taken the spot as my *favourite* honey, I can say it's made the top ten list.As far as the health claims, I'll admit that I haven't noticed anything good, bad, or otherwise when it came to my physical health and well-being while using the honey consistently for a couple of weeks.

In comparing it to the Fresh Market Gingerbread waffle mix we have on our pantry shelf, that's on the high side of average.  The FM mix has 135 calories per servings, .5 total fat, 335 mg of sodium, and 30 carb grams.

Melitta Vienna Roast is the closest thing to Starbuck's dark roast coffee as I've found and I've tried many brands.  So why, you may ask, do I give the coffee only 4 starts?  The reason for this is only that I do not like the packaging and feel that there is a lot of waste there.  The mini filter basket pods are supposed to allow more of the coffee aroma to permeate the air as it brews, but I've not found them to be any more so than regular pods.  These minibaskets are in individual hard plastic containers--so I find the packaging excessive.  Melitta should really rethink this design; pods aren't particularly environmentally friendly to start off with--but this makes the matter worse.

BEET CABBAGE: You can definitely taste both the beets and the cabbage. This one may work well as a soup base, but it wasn't very good as a stand-alone tea. BROCCOLI CILANTRO: This is one I didn't think I would like, but I did. I could taste the broccoli, but fortunately, delicious cilantro was the dominant flavor. I liked this one, but it wasn't my favorite. CARROT CURRY: This is the one that sounded the best to me, but I didn't like it that much. I would like to have tasted more carrot and less curry. FENNEL SPICE: Right out of the packet, this tea smelled like black licorice, but once it brewed it didn't really taste like licorice at all. It had more of an onion/garlic/vegetable broth-type flavor. SPINACH CHIVE: This was my favorite, completely delicious as a stand-alone tea. Its wonderful spiciness reminded me of pizza or [[ASIN:B002P16EN4  Cool Ranch Flavor Doritos Tortilla Chips]]. I could see myself ordering this tea at the coffee shop just like my usual tropical green tea order. TOMATO MINT: A nice mild tomato flavor with a mint aftertaste. It's not spicy at all, but it reminded me of a Bloody Mary mix. OVERALL: I will definitely buy a box of spinach chive tea in the future, and I will probably buy tomato mint again, but I won't get the sampler pack.

Worth a try if you are looking to add variety to your breakfast menu.",4,More sweet than vanilla flavor,1305849600
3867,AW6J9IILGOZY3,B002EY5TTW,Katawampas,"One of the reasons this tuna tastes so much better than other brands is that they only cook it once, right in the can with no added liquid.  Most brands cook their tuna twice which degrades the flavor and the texture.  This no water/oil version is my go-to choice for everyday tuna salad & even using on a green salad or eating on a cracker.  It is large pieces of tuna so after I open it, I use a butter knife & slice it in to large chunks right in the can; also helps make it easier to get out of the can.  Don't drain away the tiny bit of liquid in the can.  That liquid is the ""juices"" from the tuna; not added water.  This tuna is delicious and was the winner in the Cook's Illustrated canned tuna tasting (7/2011).Wild Planet uses fish caught by ""trolling or pole & line"" which is the recommendation by most non-governmental environmental fishing watch groups including the Monterey Bay Aquarium ""Seafood Watch"".  These fishing methods do not reach as deep in to the water so they catch younger, more tasty, more Omega 3 -rich fish & less mercury.  The bigger, older fish typically swim deeper & because they are older, they have higher mercury levels.Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood watch has an excellent website, app for your phone & a pocket guide advising on which seafood is safest to eat and sustainable.Olive Oil Version (YUM!):Wild Planet Wild Albacore Tuna in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)",5,This is Very Good Canned Tuna,1371427200

They are made with corn mesa flavor adding the crunchiness and though there is a spice flavor I can not make out the Chipotle pepper flavor.

24564,A3HQAPXAJV7PRX,B005A1LINC,Diane Kistner,"It's hard to believe this Crystal Light Moctails Mojito mix doesn't have any sodium, because it tastes a bit like a margarita. (I've never had a real mojito, so I don't know how this compares to the mixed drink.) In a glass over ice at a party, I doubt anyone could tell that it's not an alcoholic drink. Of course, I suppose you could tipple in some suitable spirits if you wanted to.What this product does have is the sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium, and I suspect the aftertaste of these in combination is what makes this Crystal Light drink taste a little salty. I know these sweeteners are chosen in part because of the long shelf life, not to mention being lower in calories than sugar, but I wish the manufacturer would consider a line using Stevia as a sweetener instead. I'd be more inclined to purchase this product if they did. I am particularly sensitive to aspartame (acesulfame potassium is a new one on me), so I tend to avoid it. The mix also contains a ""trivial amount of sugar,"" whatever that means.Otherwise, this Crystal Light is easy to mix. The package comes with five packets, each of which mixes up into 2 quarts. The taste is quite strong when made according to the directions, so if you want it a little weaker, you can easily add more water or plenty of ice cubes.",3,"Good idea, but I wish they'd use Stevia",1317945600

46249,A1QK91G8NM5XI1,B00FU1YVDQ,Fuzzbean,"Many other reviewers have concentrated negatively on the corn syrup in this formula. While I'm not crazy about it either, I keep several points in perspective:1. It is ""corn syrup"" and not the supposedly worse ""high fructose corn syrup."" They are two different things.2. Cow milk contains about 13 grams of sugar per cup. It is primarily lactose, which is broken down in the body before absorption. Presumably the breaking down process slows the absorption somewhat (I'm sure no expert) but still it is sugar and much of it ends up as glucose... which is also a major part of corn syrup.3. The famous brand Enfamil Toddler Transitions also has ""corn syrup solids"" listed as the 3rd ingredient, and actually has slightly higher total carbohydrates, so I don't think it is any better.4. When our baby was younger my wife primarily breast fed her, so formula formulas were not a huge concern to us. Now we are getting away from the breast feeding, but into solid foods. Personally I'm more concerned about the child eating cookies, ice cream, sweet fruits, and junk baby foods than I am about glucose vs. maltose vs. fructose vs. lactose in the milk she drinks.On the other hand, this product is currently priced slightly higher than the Enfamil brand, so I'm not really sure what the selling point is.",3,"Seems good, but not really cheaper.",1396224000

14276,A1D2ZD5ZAR117,B004JLQ6UE,"J. Rosenberger ""Amazon shopper""","First off, I am not a diet drink fan. I HATE artificial tasting sweetness. I don't drink diet sodas and I don't usually even like stevia. On a whim, I thought I would give Bai5 a shot. I was intrigued by the blend of sweeteners and I wondered if it would make a difference. And it did! Wow, these are sooo good. I could live on the blueberry flavor alone. After I work out, I often get a craving for something sugary and sweet and a bottle of Bai5 keeps me out of trouble. I can easily drink one undiluted as a yummy ""sugary"" snack fix, though sometimes I will split one between two or three glasses of sparkling water for a lighter tasting beverage. I'm usually the first person to have issues with the ""gastric side effects"" of artificial sweeteners, but I don't have any problems with Bai5. I only have one or two per day--might be a different story if I drank more. The caffeine doesn't bother me at all, but I'm a big coffee drinker. If you're sensitive, don't drink them too close to bedtime. It's only about 35 mg, but if you avoid caffeine, these might not work well for you. Bai5 is made of coffee berries, after all, so be aware... Now my only issue is the cost! Sheesh, these are so expensive. Had to order another case today when I saw I only had two bottles left. Maybe some day a store near me will carry them and put them on sale now and then!",5,So good! Wish they were cheaper!,1370908800
34490,A306153FTKS9PL,B00E6OIXM8,Turtle502,"K-cups are typically touch-and-go. Among various manufacturers across a multitude of flavors, you can never predict strength or flavor. That said, I can honestly say this is one of my favorite k-cup flavors.This coffee has a perfectly mint-chocolately taste, where neither the mint or chocolate is overpowering. I can only describe this as a hot-chocolate flavored coffee, without the richness of hot chocolate. When I ordered this, I thought the ""mocha"" meant it would be a creamier coffee like a cappuccino, but it is not like that, fortunately. Other than flavoring, this coffee has no additives and does not have any calories.The coffee brews dark, and has an awesome aroma. If I run my brewer and wait a few minutes before returning to the kitchen to retrieve my mug, the kitchen is filled with the mint-chocolately aroma. My only complaint is that I wish it was a more full-bodied, darker roast, as it's not as strong as I normally like my coffee.I recommend this coffee if you want something different, although drinking this daily is quite easy.",4,a great-flavored coffee,1385769600

What I really liked about this particular type of Chai Tea is that it is not as sweet. This is a major difference from others I've had and I recommend this Chia Tea product. The other added spice ingredients make up  for the lack of sweetness and it creates quite a delicious brew. It seems Lipton is trying to appeal to a different audience and is expanding  from their traditional black  tea bags.

18758,A1BJOHHLG0D965,B000FEH8ME,"M.D. Edwards ""Avid Aesthete""","If you're interested in getting your hands on a chewy, healthy, satisfying little snack, definitely consider adding these to your shopping cart!The bars aren't large - about 1 1/4 inches wide by a little over 4 inches long, and about a half inch thick - but they're packed with good, fresh, healthy flavour. The bars are nicely chewy without being gummy, and have far more flavor and are far more palatable (in my opinion) than those fruit leather strips out there. These really are almost like a chewy fruit and nut brownie in the way they're made. I do have to say, though, that if you're not a walnut lover, beware, as walnuts are the nuts that I found in the greatest supply in my bar. As the ingredients list cites walnuts as one of the nuts used, after the fact I wasn't so surprised, but since they are called cherry cashew fruit and nut bars, I was expecting to see more cashews.As the ingredients and their prevalence go, they are listed as such on the bar (everything being organic, I'm going to skip typing that out seven times): dates, cashews, cherries, rice protein concentrate (whatever that is), walnuts, agave nectar, and almonds, all raw and unprocessed.Speaking of fruit leather, these bars are about that sort of color - reddish brown, with a look of pureed fruit that's had nuts mixed into it. I do like that these are certified organic, gluten-free, raw, vegan, and contain a full serving of fruit, plenty of omega 3 fatty acids, organic protein and 3 grams of fiber per bar. I have to say, though, that I'm not keen on the fact that each little bar has 8 grams of fat, but considering that they're nut fats, they're much healthier than the other fats that might make their way into your diet.Overall, I really enjoyed the bar that I tried. It was a satisfying sweet, chewy treat without being either too sweet or too tart. The perfect little dessert bite for a healthy lunch, or a delicious afternoon snack. If you happen to see these in your local grocery's health food section, pick one up to try it, then come back to Amazon and treat yourself to a whole bunch of 'em at a better price than you're apt to find locally!*UPDATE*Ever since I had that first cherry cashew Pure bar, I've thought about them often. I've seen them in my local Trader Joe's (which I'm an AVID fan of), as well as my local Kroger/Ralph's and a few other stores in their health food/protein & health bar aisles. I've continued to think about buying them there, but the prices that they sell them for in my local area put them at about $1.99 - $2.49 each, if not more. Being the frugal soul that I am, I just knew I'd find them for less here. At just under twenty bucks for a 12 count box, these work out to about $1.67 a bar here up front. If, however, you opt to subscribe to the product (which I often do on Amazon, at a twice-yearly shipment subscription), they come out to $1.40 per bar, WITH free shipping. Needless to say, I'm sold! My first box is on its way to me right now, and I'll be able to enjoy a delicious, sweet, chewy, HEALTHY dessert-like treat whenever I want one now! Yummy! Can't WAIT for my box to arrive!Try one!
